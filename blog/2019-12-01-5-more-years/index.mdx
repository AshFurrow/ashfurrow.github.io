In 2009, I started writing iOS apps. Five years later [I wrote a retrospective
of my career so far](/blog/5-years-of-ios/). Well, it's been another five years,
so here is my next career lookback. This blog post [took six months to
write](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/pull/396). Strap in, folks!

Cast yourself back to December 2014. Where were you? My wife Ashley and I were living in Amsterdam, but
our Dutch visas were about to expire. We'd be moving to New York soon. I'd been working for Artsy for eight
months and had [just shipped my first
app](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/) for the company,
in beta versions of Swift! ([It's open
source](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon), by the way.) I had also been battling
severe depression throughout my entire time in Amsterdam,
but had stabilized somewhat ([I would begin therapy soon](/blog/depression-graphed/)).

There's a lot of uncertainty in my life right now. There've been a lot of
changes lately, both professionally [and personally](/blog/learning-to-run/).
Five years ago, I called myself an "iOS Developer", but now I don't scope myself
to a single platform. I'm leading a team, and I'm helping lead Artsy through a
critical part of its growth as a company and as a business.

I don't know where I'll be, or who I'll be, in another five years. But I'm so
excited for the journey. Thanks for reading, and take care.
