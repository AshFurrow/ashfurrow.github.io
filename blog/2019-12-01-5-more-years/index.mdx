Our Dutch visas expire in February and without a Dutch employer, we can't stay any longer. Artsy is based in New York and Canadians have a pretty easy time getting work visas, so we'll be moving there in February. As much as I will miss Amsterdam and all the friends I have here, I am looking forward to a new adventure.
TODO: Write an intro to contextualize things.

Include a bit about where we left off:

- the Kiosk
- Had depression basically all of Amsterdam and started to deal with that after moving to NYC https://ashfurrow.com/blog/depression-graphed/

Make sure I cover all these in the post, some of them are done but some are still todo.

- 2017

- 2018
  - Lots of changes at Artsy. More costly than they had to be. We lost some engineers. It was hard. I played a role in helping, and I loved it. https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/04/19/having-a-coffee-with-every-engineer/
  - I am totally on-board with React Native
  - Started coginitive beahvioural therapy, super-effective, 7 sessions and I had the skills I needed (but I was already in the right headspace to make it work, results arent typical) https://ashfurrow.com/blog/all-i-can-say-is-im-excited/
- 2019
  - I started leading a team https://ashfurrow.com/blog/reflecting-on-5-years-at-artsy/
  - More Artsy changes, like dB and Orta leaving, new CEO and COO
  - My TIL repository
  - I bought a webcam so people could see me, it became important as a TL
  - I stopped taking my medication because I didnt need it anymore https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/1124461096969097217
  - Then my team went away, and I had feelings
  - I came out lol
  - Artsy structural changes. Feels jaded, but Ive gotten so used to change at Artsy that it didnt affect me as much as I thought it might. 2018 was difficult so 2019 being difficult didnt bother me as much.
  - I got another team

Let's do an outro lol
