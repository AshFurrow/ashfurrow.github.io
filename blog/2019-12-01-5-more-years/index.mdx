Our Dutch visas expire in February and without a Dutch employer, we can't stay any longer. Artsy is based in New York and Canadians have a pretty easy time getting work visas, so we'll be moving there in February. As much as I will miss Amsterdam and all the friends I have here, I am looking forward to a new adventure.
TODO: Write an intro to contextualize things.

Include a bit about where we left off:

- the Kiosk
- Had depression basically all of Amsterdam and started to deal with that after moving to NYC https://ashfurrow.com/blog/depression-graphed/

Make sure I cover all these in the post, some of them are done but some are still todo.

Let's do an outro lol
