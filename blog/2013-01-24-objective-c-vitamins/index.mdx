This week, I gave a talk at [Tech Talks TO](http://techtalksto.com/post/40607791416/ash-furrow-presenting-accessibility-and-unit-testing) discussing the "vitamins" that the Objective-C community needs to grow up to be big and strong. Er, I mean to become a stable and mature platform.

Slides are also available as a [direct PDF download](http://static.ashfurrow.com/blog/vitamins.pdf) in case anyone is interested.

I may have been a little harsh on the community (as is my way), but I've seen way too many Stack Overflow questions with people trying to implement their own widget instead of using one that someone has already written. I also say that UI Acceptance Testing is not really feasible, which is hyperbolic. The tools are coming a long way, in no small part thanks to my friend [Paddy](https://github.com/tapi)'s work on [Frank](https://github.com/moredip/Frank).
