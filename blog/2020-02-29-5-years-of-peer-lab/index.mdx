When I lived in Amsterdam in 2014, my friend [Samuel](https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin) ran a weekly meetup, called a "peer lab", at a café near the city centre. You just showed up at the same time as other developers, grab a coffee, hop on the wifi, and work on whatever you wanted to. If you ran into problems, there were other engineers to talk to and ask for help.

I really liked the peer lab. Working remotly for a company across the ocean left me short on in-preson interations with other developers, which was common for other attendees. We worked remotely but worked together every Saturday morning. (Samuel ran the meetup on Saturday mornings to keep recruiters from showing up.)

When I moved to New York, one of the first things I did was [start a peer lab of my own](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/) out of the Artsy office. They provided the space, the wifi, and some pizza, and my colleague Orta and I ran the event. Every Saturday, still, but more because by then I was in the habbit of starting my weekend off with a productive start.

[Eventually, I built a website](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-static-sites-with-middleman/) to help other people start their own peer labs: [peerlab.community](https://peerlab.community). Dozens of peer labs have been created in all kinds of countries: The United States, Canada, Russia, Hong Kong, India, Australia, Spain... all over! It's been really rewarding to take Samuel's idea, reproduce it in New York, and then help replicate that around the world.

This month marks five years since I started the peer lab in New York. It's been a rewarding journey – I've made a lot of friends, and I've had a positive impact on a lot of people's lives. But in this post, I wanted to focus on what I've learned running the same weekly meetup for five years.

- Keep it simple.
- Don't go it alone.
- Get comfortable saying "no."
