		<p>I am a Canadian software developer currently living in New York's East Village. The last <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/">five years of my life</a> have been focused on iOS development, but I dabble. I have two cats, and when I'm not <a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow">writing open source code</a>, I like to <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/theashfurrow">write books</a> and <a href="https://500px.com/ashfurrow">make photos</a>.</p>

		<p>Community is incredibly important to me; I've only been able to accomplish what I have because of the kindness and generosity of others. I owe it to the people who helped me to help others now.  I want to lead by example and become the kind of developer that I would want to work with. That means sharing knowledge, code, and time with others. To that end, I've been working toward becoming <a href="http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html">Open Source by Default</a> in all aspects of my life.</p>

		<p>Over my young career, I've been fortunate to work at some amazing places.</p>

		<h3>Artsy</h3>
		<p>The goal of <a href="https://www.artsy.net">Artsy</a> is simple, but ambitious: make art as popular as music. Here, I work on a team to build Artsy's different iOS apps â€“ mostly as open source software, which is amazing ðŸŽ‰</p>

		<h3>Teehan+Lax</h3>
		<p>After learning the importance of design at 500px, I moved to <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com">Teehan+Lax</a> â€“ Canada's leading design agency â€“ to learn more. I developed skills collaborating with designers to work with clients to realize their products.</p>

		<h3>500px</h3>
		<p><a href="https://500px.com/">500px</a> is a site that aims to host the world's best photography. Like flickr, but only for your <em>best</em> shots. While there, I developed the iPad app, and later led the iOS team to ship the universal iOS app.</p>
