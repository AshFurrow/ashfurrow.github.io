	      <p>I've looked around for examples of software developer portfolios, and mostly I've just found people advocating that developers should have one, while providing very few answers as to what it should be or look like. What is a developer portfolio, anyway? Is it a resumé? Is it list of accomplishments? Is it a list at all? </p>
	      
				<p>The freedom of the web and availability of high-quality, open source tools like Bootstrap have encouraged me to grow beyond the role of a traditional developer. I decided that my portfolio would be something important to me, showing what matters to me as a professional. A snapshot of me. </p>

				<p>I make a lot of things. A lot of those things are software. A lot of them aren't. Let's start from the top.</p>

				  		<p>Since April 2014, I've worked at <a href="http://www.artsy.net">Artsy</a>, a company with the ambitious goal of making art as popular as music. I work within a small team making a few different iOS apps, from the main consumer app to a custom-built auctions kiosk.</p>
							<p>Artsy encourages me to grow and learn, and to share that knowledge with others: most of my work in done in the open, and I often write articles for <a href="http://artsy.github.io">Artsy's developer blog</a>.</p>

				  		<p>35mm was an amibitious project that I undertook in a team of two others: a designer and an editor. We aimed to change the world for photography-lovers by providing curated photography without advertisements. Although the project was not a success from a financial standpoint, I learnt a lot about writing Newsstand magazines for iOS, including architecting our own backend server in Node.js.</p>

				  		<p>I was hired in 2011 as the iOS developer at 500px. I architected and shipped the iPad application. I helped design new features, plan the product roadmap, and respond to customer support inquiries, all while continuing to ship an amazing product.</p>
							<p>Eventually, the team grew, and I stepped up to fulfil the team's lead position. From there, I played a crucial role in the design and development of the iPhone application, which shipped late 2012.</p>
							<p>500px is <a href="https://500px.com/apps/ipad">available on the App Store</a>, where it has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of users.</p>

This app enables users to collect moments they've captured through Instagram to tell a comprehensive, compelling story, published on 500px.</p>
							<p>Pursuant to Instagram's new Terms of Service, we were forced to shut down storygram late 2013.</p>

	    	<p>Since I was a teenager, I've been fascinated with open source software. Not just the software itself, but the communities surrounding different projects. No one individual could have accomplished the feats of open source software – it takes collaboration and teamwork. I grew up believe that we can accomplish more if we work together. </p>
				<p>Today, I try and practice radical openness – the idea that unless there is a good reason to keep something secret, then you should share it. Every time. </p>
				<p>At Artsy, we call it "open source by default." At Teehan+Lax, we called it "creating more value than you capture." Before that, I didn't really have a name for it. I just knew that it was a lot of fun. </p>

				<p>I try and participate in the developer community by attending community events and meeting new people. I participate in various open source projects on GitHub and use StackOverflow to ask others for help (and to provide help to others). I co-host a podcast about the iOS world from a cultural perspective, and I encourage people to ask questions on Twitter. </p>
