description: I've looked around for examples of software developer portfolios, and mostly I've just found people advocating that developers should have one (while providing very few answers as to what it should be or look like). What is a developer portfolio, anyway? Is it a resumé? Is it list of accomplishments? Is it a list at all?

        %p I've looked around for examples of software developer portfolios, and mostly I've just found people advocating that developers should have one (while providing very few answers as to what it should be or look like). What is a developer portfolio, anyway? Is it a resumé? Is it list of accomplishments? Is it a list at all?

        %p The freedom of the web and availability of high-quality, open source tools like Bootstrap have encouraged me to grow beyond the role of a "iOS" developer. I decided that my portfolio would be something important to me, something that shows what matters. A snapshot of me.

        %p I make a lot of things. A lot of those things are software. A lot of them aren't. Let's start from the top.

        %p Great software is software nobody notices. I write meaningful software with this aspiration.

        %p I've been writing iOS apps since 2009, when I was still in university. Since then, most significant software I've written has been on the iOS platform. I do, however, have an interest in web technologies, and have built the site you're currently reading.

            %h3 Artsy
            %img{:src => '/img/portfolio/artsy.jpg'}/
            %div
              %p Since April 2014, I've worked for <a href='https://www.artsy.net'>Artsy</a>, a company with the ambitious goal of making art as popular as music. I work within a small team that makes a few different iOS apps, from the main consumer app to a custom-built auctions kiosk.
              %p Artsy encourages me to grow and learn, and to share that knowledge with others: most of my work is done in the open, and I often write articles for <a href='http://artsy.github.io'>Artsy's developer blog</a>
          %li
            %h3 35mm
            %img{:src => '/img/portfolio/35mm.jpg'}/
            %div
              %p 35mm was an ambitious project that I undertook in a team of two others: a designer and an editor. We aimed to change the world for photography-lovers by providing curated photography without advertisements. Although the project was not a success from a financial standpoint, I learnt a lot about writing Newsstand magazines for iOS, including architecting our own backend server in Node.js.
              %p This project is no longer available on the App Store.
          %li
            %h3 500px
            %img{:src => '/img/portfolio/500px.jpg'}/
            %div
              %p In 2011, I began as the only iOS developer at 500px, architecting and shipping the iPad app. I helped design new features, plan the product roadmap, and respond to customer support inquiries, all while continuing to ship an amazing product.
              %p Eventually, the team grew, and I stepped up to fulfil the team's lead position. From there, I played a crucial role in the design and development of the iPhone application, which shipped late 2012. 500px is <a href='https://500px.com/apps/ipad'>available on the App Store</a>, where it has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of users.
          %li
            %h3 Storygram
            %img{:src => '/img/portfolio/storygram.jpg'}/
            %div
              %p Storygram is the product of a weekend of work that <a href='http://twitter.com/tomcreighton'>Tom Creighton</a> and I did as participants in the Pixel Hack Day, organized by 500px. It was actually featured on <a href='http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/01/06/instagram-meets-500px-with-the-new-ios-app-storygram/'>The Next Web</a>, as well as the Great Canadian Apps section in the App Store. This app enabled users to collect moments they've captured through Instagram to tell a comprehensive, compelling story, published on 500px.
              %p Pursuant to Instagram's new Terms of Service, we were forced to shut down Storygram late 2013.

        %p Since I was a teenager, I've been fascinated with open source software. Not just the software itself, but the communities surrounding different projects. No one individual could accomplish the feats of open source software – it takes collaboration and teamwork. I grew up believing that we can accomplish more if we work together.

        %p Today, I try to practice "radical openness" – the idea that unless there is a good reason to keep something secret, then you should share it. Every time.

        %p At Artsy, we call it "open source by default." At Teehan+Lax, we called it "creating more value than you capture." Before that, I didn't really have a name for it. I just knew that it was a lot of fun.

        %p I try and participate in the developer community by attending community events and meeting new people. I participate in various open source projects on GitHub and use StackOverflow to ask others for help (and to provide help to others). I co-host a podcast about the iOS world from a cultural perspective, and I encourage people to ask questions on Twitter.

At <a href='http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/author/ash/'>Teehan+Lax</a>, I began contributing to company blog as part of my job. I still do, now on <a href='http://artsy.github.io'>Artsy's developer blog</a>. I've also written posts for <a href='http://www.objc.io/contributors.html'>objc.io</a>.

Not long after that, I started being invited to come speak at venues. I've spoken at local meetups in Warsaw and Copenhagen and at conferences from San Francisco to Minsk.

        %p Over the past few years, I have developed an increasingly intense interest in photography. Working to improve my skills, I've explored the medium and come to love shooting on film most of all. I now shoot and process my film at home, and I'm beginning to explore darkroom printing.
        %p My photography and my work as a software developer are closely related. Both help exercise different creative processes and I pay attention to what I learn. Often lessons about field can be applied to the other. You can see my work at the links below.
