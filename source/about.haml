      %p I am a world-class software developer living in New York's East Village. The last <a href='http://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/'>five years of my life</a> have been focused on iOS development, but I dabble. I have two cats, and when I'm not <a href='https://github.com/ashfurrow'>contributing in open source</a>, I like to <a href='https://leanpub.com/u/theashfurrow'>write books</a> and <a href='https://500px.com/ashfurrow'>make photos</a>.

      %p Community is incredibly important to me; I've only been able to accomplish what I have because of the kindness and generosity of others. I owe it to the people who helped me to help others now. I want to lead by example and become the kind of developer that I would want to work with. That means sharing knowledge, code, and time with others. To that end, I've been working toward becoming <a href='http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html'>Open Source by Default</a> in all aspects of my life.

      %p Over my career, I've been fortunate to work at some amazing places.

      %h3 Artsy
      %p The goal of <a href='https://www.artsy.net'>Artsy</a> is simple, but ambitious: make art as popular as music. Here, I work on a team to build Artsy's different iOS apps â€“ <a href='http://www.objc.io/issue-22/artsy.html'>mostly as open source software</a>, which is amazing ðŸŽ‰

      %h3 Teehan+Lax
      %p After learning the importance of design at 500px, I moved to <a href='http://www.teehanlax.com'>Teehan+Lax</a> â€“ Canada's leading design agency â€“ to learn more. I developed keen collaboration skills while working closely with designers and clients to realize outstanding products.

      %h3 500px
      %p <a href='https://500px.com/'>500px</a> is a site that aims to host the world's best photography. Like flickr, but only for your <em>best</em> shots. I developed their first iPad app, and later led the iOS team to ship the new universal app.
