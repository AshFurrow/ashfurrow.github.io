<p>This week, I read an excellent article on <a href="http://www.goodbytes.be/blog/article/life-moves-pretty-fast.-here-are-5-things-you-can-do-to-slow-down">slowing down</a>. The author posits that life moves very quickly, especially when you're in the computer industry. Things never seem to slow down long enough to catch your breath. </p>

<p>The article was very timely for me, since I'm under a lot of stress at work with a nigh-impossible deadline; the idea of slowing down, even while maintaining a fast pace of life really resonated with me.</p>

<p>I don't want to just republish the article, but to summarize, the five points are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Shave with a straight razor</li>

<li>Run</li>

<li>Cook</li>

<li>Read</li>

<li>Travel</li>

</ol>

<p>Great list. My favourite is actually shaving; while I don't use a straight razor, I do use a safety razor, which (despite its name) demands attention, time, and skill to successfully use.</p>

<p>I'd like to add one of my own. Coffee.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. "Coffee? Coffee makes me go faster, not slower!" Yes, that's true. However, I make deliberate, quality coffee that demands focus and attention.</p>

<p>When I get up, the first thing I do it turn on my espresso machine. It takes at least 30 minutes to heat up its 1.2 litre boiler.</p>

<p>This is how I begin each shot of espresso. I feed 18 grams of coffee beans into a quality espresso grinder. It produces a fine, consistent grind of coffee. I carefully dose the grinds so they fill the basket evenly before I lock in the portafilter and pull my shot.</p>

<p>It takes a few minutes to pull a shot and steam the milk for a latte, but it is so worth it. And every morning, I get to look forward to this ritual.</p>

<p>So I'm going to take it a little easier and slow down in the ways I can. When I move fast, I want to move decisively, but when I can take time to enjoy life, I will.</p>
