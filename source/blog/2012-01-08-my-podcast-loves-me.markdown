<import><p>It's no small secret that I'm hilarious. Since starting at 500px, I've worked with people who are also hilarious, so we started a podcast! It's called "<a href="http://dashdashforce.me/" target="_blank">--force</a>" (like you do on the command line) since it's ostensibly about what it takes to work at a startup. (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast//id486218686" target="_blank">iTunes link</a>)</p>
<p>The first two episodes suffer from poor audio quality. Episode three is where we really start to get good. The most recent episode is described by:</p>
<blockquote><p>Joe Startup, desingineers, specializations, a story about Ash on the streetcar, Lisp, liking your job, having sex on the TTC, yarn poisoning, Jeff Atwood refuses to poop, the Galaxy Tab, and Android-powered vibrators.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each Friday afternoon, we sit in a soundproof-but-not-really room and record an hour or so of discussion about the weekly happenings. Usually with some form of alcohol.</p>
