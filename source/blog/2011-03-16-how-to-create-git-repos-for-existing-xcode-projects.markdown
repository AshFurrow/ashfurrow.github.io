<p>UPDATE: Apparently just initializing an empty repository in the project directory is enough; Xcode autodetects it for you. It be nice if something to that effect was in the documentation. Thanks to Jason for that (<a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/creating_a_git_repository_for_an_existing_xcode_project" target="_blank">details here</a>). Open the project directory in a terminal and type the following:
</p>

<pre>git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"</pre>

<p>I got Xcode 4 - pretty impressive. I've been waiting to get this stable release since I was at the demos at WWDC last Summer. I was particularly excited about the new Git integration.</p>

<p>New Xcode projects will let you keep local git source control. Using an existing project with this local source control is ... difficult. I tried for a while before almost giving up. Documentation around the "Add Working Copy" is almost non-existent. This is how you do it.Â </p>

<ol>
<li>Move your existing project folder to your desktop.</li>
<li>Make a new, empty project in Xcode with the same name as your project. Make sure the box for using a .git repo is selected.</li>
<li>Close Xcode.</li>
<li>Copy all files from the project folder on your desktop to the new project folder Xcode created.</li>
<li>Double-click the project file.</li>
<li>You'll now need to add all the files to the source control since (they'll all have question marks beside them, shown right).</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried adding initializing an empty git repo and importing into Xcode with no luck. If anyone has a better solution, please let me know!</p>
