<import><p>I just got an interesting form email from the CEO of <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, which read, in part, as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In recent weeks, Twitter announced policy changes* that will affect how applications and users like yourself can interact with Twitter's data. As a result of these changes, on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook. </p>
  
  <p>*These Twitter policy changes specifically disallow uploading Twitter Content to a "cloud based service" (Section 4A <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms</a>) and include stricter enforcement of the Developer Display Requirements (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements">https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements
  </a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IFTTT is a fantastic service that basically allows you to connect any online service to any another with what they call "receipes." Lately, recipes for taking <em>your</em> tweets and sending a copy of them to <a href="https://alpha.app.net/global/">App.net</a> have sprung up. </p>

<p>Twitter is likely taking this action against IFTTT to prevent users from sending their own tweets to this service, which is kind of a dick move, but one I've been expecting since I saw the first ADN recipe. </p>

<p>It's certainly the kind of move we've come to expect from Twitter.</p>

<p><em>Golf clap</em>.</p></import>
