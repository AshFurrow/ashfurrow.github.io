<p>I wanted to clarify something from my <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/moving-to-amsterdam">moving to Amsterdam</a> post that I left purposefully ambiguous at the time. </p>

<p>I mentioned the Booking.com job I had applied for in the post. I was still in the process of applying for that job, as well as a few others. I didn't get the Booking.com job, but rather have secured a job at a pre-launch startup. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't say much more than that. I will tell you that I am characteristically excited about their product and that it's something that I believe could have a significant, positive impact on the world we live in. I'm looking forward to starting with them late February. </p>
