<p>I read an article this morning on <a href="http://codesheriff.blogspot.com/2011/11/excuse-5-frequent-refactoring-excuse.html" target="_blank">Test-Driven Development</a>, or TDD. TDD is the software development paradigm that dictates that you don't write any code without first writing tests for that code; that way, you'll know when you're done (all the tests pass).<!--more--> Without getting into the pros or cons of TDD, my main problem with this article is the holier-than-thou attitude its authors take.
This is all to common in discussions regarding TDD: "if you're finding it hard to follow TDD, it's because you're not a capable enough programmer." Or, "if you're finding writing tests is taking too long compared to simply debugging problems, then you're doing it wrong."</p>

<p>Both of these statements <em>may</em> be true, but certainly aren't always. There are legitimate criticisms to TDD. I won't list them because I don't want Hacker News commenters to start nitpicking. I <em>hate</em> nitpicking. The problem is really that whenever someone brings up a problem with TDD, they're shot down with religious vigour and told the problem isn't TDD, the problem is <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>Well, fuck that.</p>

<p>Maybe TDD doesn't work for <em>every</em> developer on <em>every</em> project written with <em>every</em> language using <em>every</em> framework.</p>

<p>The fact that I can only say this is <em>maybe</em> true without invoking the wrath of TDD Believers is a testament to how unthinkingly some developers push TDD.</p>

<p>To me, the main benefit to TDD was never actually the tests - the tests are meaningless! The main point to TDD is stopping. Thinking. Planning.</p>

<p>Before coding.</p>

<p>TDD may work well for you and your team on your project. It may, however, not. And there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
