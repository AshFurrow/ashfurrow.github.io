Today my coworkers in the [Teehan+Lax Labs](http://www.teehanlax.com/labs/) group launched [Google Street View Hyperlapse](http://www.teehanlax.com/labs/hyperlapse/) that you should totally check out.

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/63653873?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1" data-embed="true" webkitallowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" class="embed-responsive-item"></iframe></div>

Imagine programmatically stitching together hours of Google Street View imagery to create moving time-lapse videos. Amazing.

The source is [up on GitHub](https://github.com/TeehanLax/Hyperlapse.js).

I feel so lucky to get to work with really creative people who would come up with an idea like this, and then execute it so well. This is the firsts T+L Labs project that I've seen from beginning to end, and it's been awesome to see the team work on it. Good job, guys.
