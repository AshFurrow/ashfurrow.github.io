<p>Today my coworkers in the <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/labs/">Teehan+Lax Labs</a> group launched <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/labs/hyperlapse/">Google Street View Hyperlapse</a> that you should totally check out. </p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe data-image-dimensions="1280x720" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/63653873?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1" width="1280" data-embed="true" webkitallowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="720" class="embed-responsive-item"></iframe></div>

<p>Imagine programmatically stitching together hours of Google Street View imagery to create moving time-lapse videos. Amazing. </p>

<p>The source is <a href="https://github.com/TeehanLax/Hyperlapse.js">up on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I feel so lucky to get to work with really creative people who would come up with an idea like this, and then execute it so well. This is the firsts T+L Labs project that I've seen from beginning to end, and it's been awesome to see the team work on it. Good job, guys. </p>
