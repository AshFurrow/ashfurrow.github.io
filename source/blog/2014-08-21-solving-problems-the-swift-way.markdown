<import><p>Recently, I was asked to speak at <a href="http://swiftcrunch.com">SwiftCrunch</a>, the first ever Swift hackathon. I gave a talk on solving problems using idiomatic Swift; that is, how do we solve problems "the Swift way"?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>What's really key – fundamental to both my presentation and my belief about Swift – is that we, as a developer community, are going to face problems in Swift that we are already familiar with. The first time you go to implement <code>UITableViewDataSource</code> in Swift, you're going to be solving what's likely a problem you've solved before in Objective-C. This time, you're using Swift. The naïve approach to solving this familiar problem would be to use a familiar solution, but that would be a missed opportunity. Swift presents many new language features and many new ways to solve existing, familiar problems. It would be a shame not to explore those new solutions to see if maybe some of them are better than the Objective-C ones. </p>

<p>So here's my presentation. My slides are <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/solving-problems-the-swift-way-swiftcrunch">online</a>, too. Please send any feedback you've got!</p>
