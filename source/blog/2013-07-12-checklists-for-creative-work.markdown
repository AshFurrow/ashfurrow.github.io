<import><p>My coworker Eric wrote a great article entitled <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/checklists-for-creative-work/">Checklists for Creative Work</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Checklists have been used in aviation for over 70 years. The first one was created in response to a pilot error that brought down a Boeing Model 299. ... the use of checklists proved it was simply too complex for one personâ€™s memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd strongly encourage you to read the article. Programming, I have argued, is a creative process and Eric's advice for use of checklists apply very well to developers. </p></import>
