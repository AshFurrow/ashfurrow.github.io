<p>Regular readers of my blog may have noticed that I haven't posted lately. Mostly, this has been because photography has taken up most of creative energy (outside of my job, anyway). Additionally, after contributing a few chapters to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430243686/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1430243686&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashfur-20">a book on Objective-C</a> was pretty taxing on me as a writer. <!--more--></p>

<p>I was not expecting the insane amount of work that was required in writing a technical book. It really made me question my prowess as an Objective-C developer and as a writer.</p>

<p>If you're interested in my growth as a photographer, you can take a peak at my best work on my <a href="http://500px.com/ashfurrow">500px profile</a>. I'll try to post more regularly here.</p>
