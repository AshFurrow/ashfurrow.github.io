<import><p>Ashley sent me a <a href="http://cup.ca/survey" target="_blank">survey</a> for the Canadian University PressÂ because she knew that I'd appreciate tearing it apart on my blog. I'm looking forward to our life together.
First off, we have this gem:</p>

<p>They want to know how you found out about the survey:</p>

When I didn't check any one in, of course it gave me an error.</p>
<p>Then there was this awful table trying to get you to select on radio button per column to rate some items in order of importance:</p>

It's confusing and doesn't behave according to any convention. A better solution would be reorderable list, a la iPhone:</p>

<p>The survey bored me to tears and about the only redeeming quality I can discern is the fact that clicking anywhere in the div of a radio button would select it for you. Oh, and the iPad giveaway.</p></import>
