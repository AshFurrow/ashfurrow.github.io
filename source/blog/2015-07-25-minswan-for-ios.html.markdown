The programming language Ruby was created by a software developed named [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto). He arguably leads the Ruby community, and he is so nice that that the community has adopted the following expression: "Matz is nice so we are nice." It's used so much that it [has its own Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN) and has been abbreviated as [MINSWAN](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-08-19-matz-is-nice-so-we-are-nice). 

The thing is that the iOS community doesn't really have a leader. I mean, I guess we have Apple, but they're not a person, and they're certainly not _nice_ in the way that engenders a compulsion to act nicely. 

<!-- more -->

So if the iOS community doesn't have an analogue to Matz, is there hope of having an analogous sentiment? Can we make a MINSWAN for iOS – if not in name, then at least in spirit?

Absolutely.

----------------

The thing is that Matz isn't _really_ the reason that the Ruby community is full of nice people. Consider a newcomer to Ruby; they're don't act nice because Matz does – they don't even know who Matz is yet! People in the Ruby community are nice because everyone else in the Ruby community is.

The iOS community doesn't need a Matz just so we can have a "Matz is nice so we are nice." Instead, we need a "everyone else is nice so I am nice too."

In order to get that, we need everyone to be nice, first. 

----------------

Is the iOS community a nice enough place that we can have this sentiment become widespread? 

No. 

But it's close. 

I feel like a noticeable shift in the community has occurred over the past 18 months or so. Fewer angry assholes. More collaborators on open source projects. Fewer angry rants. More cat GIFs. It's no surprise that this change coincides with Swift's announcement – the language has precipitated an explosion of open source Swift code. More open source has meant more people interacting and empathizing with one another.

The ideal of MINSWAN for iOS – for "everyone else is nice so I am nice too" – is achievable. We need a critical mass of iOS developers to adopt this approach, and we can do it. 

There are two important steps:

1. Give honest and constructive feedback when you see wanton negativity.
1. Graciously accept and reflect on feedback given to us.

Negativity happens! But it doesn't always have to spread. It doesn't have to be the norm.

----------------

Let's look an example. Consider Bob. He's angry. He says:

> I don't like X because it's stupid. Anyone who uses X is stupid, too.

Sounds like Bob might be having a bad day. Alice sees this and replies:

> That's not very kind, Bob. 

What does Bob do now? He can accept Carol's feedback, realize that he's being a jerk, and stop. Or he can ignore Carol and keep being an asshole. 

If Bob keeps being a jerk, Carol has a decision to make: is Bob someone she wants to follow? Is he worth paying attention to?

----------------

If someone you follow is being a jerk, let them know. If they don't change, consider unfollowing them. Or maybe just muting them for a week to see how much better your timeline becomes.

Think about how much happier you could be without a constant stream of negativity flowing into your brain!

[Orta](http://twitter.com/orta) has said that "[friction gets followers](https://realm.io/news/altconf-orta-therox-being-nice-in-open-source/)" – and that's true, but only if we let it. 

There are some easy, non-confrontational ways to approach someone and give feedback.

- Ask if they're OK – sometimes, they might just need someone to talk to.
- Let them know they're being negative. "That's not very kind." "I don't think that's as funny as you think it is." 
- Be upfront and address the comments, not the person.
- Remember, being negative doesn't make someone a bad person.

I'm not saying you should unfollow anyone based on a few angry tweets – it's a last resort, but it's always an option. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow">@ashfurrow</a> Negativity is definitely contagious, but a small action can also change somebody&#39;s attitude.&#10;You never know :)</p>&mdash; Junior B.

We can make this a nicer community – a nicer place to work and play. Small acts can make a big difference. Reach out, empathize, and pay attention to who you pay attention to.
