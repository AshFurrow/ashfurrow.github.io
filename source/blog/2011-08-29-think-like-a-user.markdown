<import><p>A few weeks ago, when I upgraded to OS X Lion, I notice Chrome could do bounce-scrolling. That is, if I was at the top of the page and tried to scroll further up, it would move the page down a bit, but as soon as I let go of the trackpad, the page "bounced" back to its original position. Well ... it didn't <em>quit</em> bounce scroll. It would if you weren't at the top of the page. If you started from the middle and did a quick scroll up or down, it would bounce. A little. Reluctantly. Kind of like a "well, gosh, I guess I'll bounce." Every other scrollable view in Lion bounced, but not Chrome.
This frustrated me as a user. I wanted to bounce. I liked bouncing. I assume that Google realized that it was silly to <em>stop</em> users from bouncing because the latest Chrome Dev build now has full bounce support. Rejoice!</p>
<p>I once joined an iPhone project where the lead developer had <em>disabled</em> bouncing on all scrollable views and tables. No bouncing. Anywhere. Because "he didn't like it."</p>
<p>As a developer, <em>you're not a user</em>. Let me say that again, as a developer, you are <em>not</em> a user. If you expect your software to fare well against the competition, you've got to make it behave as the user expects. You've got to think like a user, or you'll go out of business.</p></import>
