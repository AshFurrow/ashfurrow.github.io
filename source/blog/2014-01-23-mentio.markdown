<p>Came across an interesting app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mentio-personal-media-wish/id796557338?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v6zC">Mentio</a> that serves as a wishlist for apps, movies, and albums. </p>

<p>It's really neat how it integrates in with the iTunes catalogue. I assume it's using affiliate links to make money somehow. What a novel idea. Wish I had thought of it. </p>
