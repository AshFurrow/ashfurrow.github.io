<p>The Apple developer portal has been down since last Thursday. With iOS 7 imminent, the timing couldn't be worse. </p>

<p>The alleged attacker, Ibrahim Balic, has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/21/apple-confirms-that-the-dev-center-has-potentially-been-breached-by-hackers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=87472293">claimed to have information</a> about 100 000+ users. He also claims to have done this with whitehat intentions.</p>

<p>We don't know how long he waited between reporting the secrity issue to Apple before he infiltrated the system. We don't know much at all, actually. </p>

<p>However, I can't help but feel very frustrated that his "research" has severely impacted the ability for six million registered developers to do their job. </p>
