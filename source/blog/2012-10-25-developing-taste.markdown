I consider software development a creative process; writing code is like directing a play where you instruct different parts of your program on where to be, what to do, and when to do it.

People develop the ability to criticize far before they learn the ability to create, and those critical skills are often detrimental to their early creative efforts. If you're out there learning to code, don't be discouraged. It is a monumental undertaking, but you will only ever improve with experience.
