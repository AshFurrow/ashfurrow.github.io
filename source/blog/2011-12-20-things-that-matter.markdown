<import><p>I came across a job listing at <a href="http://tumblr.theresumator.com/apply/WnPaaV/IOS-Engineer.html?source=Tumblr+Jobs+Page" target="_blank">Tumblr for an iOS Engineer</a>. Tumblr can be really picky about what developers they choose to hire, and this is the criteria they've come up with.<!--more-->
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A history of shipping iOS software.</li>
<li>Ability to write idiomatic Objective-C code.</li>
<li>Deep understanding of Cocoa design patterns and API design.</li>
<li>An appreciation for pragmatism and simplicity in code.</li>
<li>Knowledge of iOS performance techniques.</li>
<li>A strong product and design sensibility.</li>
<li>Enthusiasm for Tumblr as a product.</li>
<li>A good sense of humor and a love of collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like this list. Not only because one of the largest Internet companies around today is listing qualifications that I meet, but also because this is really atypical of job listing requirements.</p>
<p>Most listings have requirements that read like product spec sheets. "Experience with [random list of buzzwords]", "<a href="http://dashdashforce.me/2011/12/force-episode-two/" target="_blank">Standing for Excellence</a>", and "5+ years iOS app development experience [sic]." Trust me - I've gone through the job hunting process for a fulltime iOS dev positions twice this year, and this is really common.</p>
<p>I love this list because it emphasizes what's really important: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html" target="_blank">getting things done</a>. Tumblr doesn't give a shit if you're fresh out of school as long as you have a demonstrable ability to write software.</p>
<p>They want developers who work in a team to accomplish something amazing, not rockstar developers that don't get along with others.</p>
<p>They're looking for enthusiasm, not a willingness to work 14 hour days.</p>
<p>They know that amazing products are written with amazing code by capable and experienced developers.</p>
<p>If I'm ever in a position to hire developers, this is exactly the list I'm using on the job listing.</p></import>
