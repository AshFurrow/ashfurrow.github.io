<p>Go check out <a href="http://releasenotes.tv">Release Notes</a>, a new podcast for iOS from a pair of pretty smart dudes.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, <em>another</em> podcast about iOS, but this one is diffrent. It doesn't talk about design or coding, but rather the <em>business</em> of iOS. Definitely worth checking out. </p>

<p>Their <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/1-conference-junkies/">inaugural episode</a> is about conferences and it discusses the value of conferences, how to choose one to attend, and how to get the most out of it. </p>
