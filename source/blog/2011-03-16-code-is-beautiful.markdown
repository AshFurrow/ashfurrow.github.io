<import><p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nanoinfinity" target="_blank">classmate of mine</a> wrote an interesting blog post yesterday about how <a href="http://philenotfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/code-is-beautiful.html" target="_blank">Code is Beautiful</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>Code is poetry. It's creativity. Code tells a story, and a very complex one at that. Coding is a creative problem solving exercise. A finished program both describes and solves a problem</blockquote>
<p>This is something I've <a href="http://blogs.unb.ca/ash-furrow/2010/12/13/programming-as-art/" target="_blank">discussed before</a>. I think programming can be artful and I use it as a creative outlet. Furthermore, it encourages use of a semicolon in everyday writing, my favourite punctuation symbol; you should all use them, too.</p></import>
