<import><p><a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org">Interesting read</a> about reactive programming. More to do with server-side stuff, but still interesting. It's a little long, but even reading just "The Need to Go Reactive" section is worth your while if you've ever wondered about ReactiveCocoa. </p>
