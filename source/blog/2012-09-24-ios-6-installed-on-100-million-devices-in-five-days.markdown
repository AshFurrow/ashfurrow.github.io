<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html">Whoa</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in seeing some serious nerd angst, look at the <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/12/09/23/0036246/ios-6-adoption-tops-25-after-just-48-hours">Slashdot Article Comments</a> discussing how comparing Android OS adoption numbers to iOS adoption numbers is <em>totally not cool, man</em>. </p>

<p>iOS 6 surpassed not only the recent Jelly Bean release of Android, but also the year-old release of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/development/mobility/android-40-ice-cream-sandwich-adoption-j/240004808">Ginger Bread</a>. And it did it in <em>three days</em>. </p>

<p>If each copy of iOS 6 is about 900MB (the size of the download form Apple's Developer Portal), and it was downloaded 100 million times, that's 90 <em>petabytes</em> of data transfer in three days, while Apple also updates OS X <em>and</em> a new iPhone 5 <em>and</em> continuing to run its other online services like the App Store, iTunes Match, etc. </p>

<p>That's incredible. </p>
