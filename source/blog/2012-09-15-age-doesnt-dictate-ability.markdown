<p>This morning I read an interesting article written by Jared Erondu entitled <em><a href="http://theindustry.cc/2012/09/14/youre-young-im-18-so-what/">You're Young. I'm 18. So what?</a>.</em> It was a fascinating read detailing his long history with entrepreneurship and a struggle to be taken seriously in an adult world.</p>

<p>Our society is structured so that we separate children from adults in a way that has never been seen in human history until the industrial revolution. In addition to keeping children isolated from adults, we've created an in-between stage called "adolescence", which again, didn't exist until <em>very</em> recently.</p>

<p>Jared Erondu's story about having to <em>hide</em> his age because he feared people would judge him not based on his capabilities, but by the perceived capabilities of his peers, is tragic.  </p>

<p>I know people who are more responsible at the age of 16 than most adults would ever be. And I know people who are 50 who act like children. So why has our society institutionalized the concept of judging someone based on their age? </p>

<p>I'm very interested in this topic, especially given the ramifications of <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/2011/11/democratize-all-of-the-things">the Internet</a>. I would highly recommend the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/188495670X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=188495670X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashfur-20">The Case Against Adolescence</a></em> if you'd like to learn more about the history of adolescence and the motivations behind those who institutionalized the concept. </p>
