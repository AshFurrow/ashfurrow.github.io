<import><p>Last week, my wife and I returned from a trip to Copenhagen, then Warsaw. I spoke at two meetups in the cities, got to visit some new places, and take some photos. It was a really great trip. </p>

<p>In Copenhagen, I gave a rendition of my <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/solving-problems-the-swift-way">Solving Problems the Swift Way</a> presentation at a <a href="https://secure.trifork.com/cph-2014/freeevent/index.jsp?eventOID=6461">GotoNight</a>. Great attendance with some excellent questions. Really nice city – we stayed at an Airbnb very close to the city centre. </p>

Really cool venue – sort of an outdoor cafe that got pretty chilly later in the evening. <a href="tweetbot:///user_profile/ceterum_censeo">Robb Böhnke</a> was also presenting and gave an inspiring talk about iOS accessiblilty. </p>

When we moved to Amsterdam, I looked forward to getting to know the local Appsterdam folk. I didn't anticipate having the opportunity to travel about Europe and give presentations to different local groups. It has been one of the most gratifying aspects of my time here so far. </p></import>
