<p>Really happy to share the news that the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/code-debugging-the-gender-gap">documentary</a> on the gender gap in the software scene that I <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/why-is-this-difficult">blogged about</a> recently got funded today. Really awesome news. </p>

<p>I want to thank anyone who donated money and/or shared this project with others. It may not be my place to thank you, but I'm doing it anyway because this came very close to not happening, and I feel like anyone who helped out should feel good about it. We did it &#x2013; great work, team!</p><img src="/img/import/blog/documentary-follow-up/42E150EE4A9B48CEB5B8B12ACABB99C4.gif" class="img-responsive" />
