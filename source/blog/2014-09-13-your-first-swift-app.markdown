<import><p>This morning I launched my new Swift book, <em><a href="https://leanpub.com/yourfirstswiftapp/">Your First Swift App</a></em>. It's a work-in-progress that will be updated as I write more chapters; currently, the first three of eleven are finished. All of the code is <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/yourfirstswiftapp">available on GitHub</a> and will be updated as I go. Anyone who bought the <a href="https://leanpub.com/your-first-ios-app">older version</a> for iOS 6/7 with Objective-C should have already received a coupon for a free copy of the Swift version. </p>

<p>This has been a struggle for me. I actually expected the book to be completed by the time Swift hit 1.0, but I struggled a lot over the Summer with depression. Only over the past few weeks have I gotten the motivation to continue. I'm grateful to my wife and friends for supporting me through the past six months. </p>

<p>To the degree that you're comfortable helping me spread the word about my book, I would be grateful for any tweets or blog posts about it. Thanks a lot, everyone. </p></import>
