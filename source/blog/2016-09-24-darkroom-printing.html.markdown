A few weeks ago, I participated in [NYCWLK][nycwlk], a darkroom workshop and photo walk. I had been looking forward to this all summer – darkroom printing is arcane, requires equipment and chemicals, and a dark room. Having someone experienced show me the ropes in the [Bushwick Community Darkroom][bcd] was the perfect way to try it out.

Here's the gist of how things work: when you take a film photo, a _negative_ is created on a piece of plastic. It's called a negative because the dark parts of the photo are clear, and the brights parts of the photo are dark. When you want to create a photo from your negative, you basically shine a light from one side and project the negative image (enlarged) on a piece of paper, creating a negative image _of the negative_. This recreates the original scene.

What has fascinated me about this process is _just how analogue it is_. Film photography is obviously analogue, but there's some science to it, especially around metering light to get a proper exposure. In the darkroom, you cut test strips and try over and over with different exposure times and contrast levels until you see what you like. It's all very subjective and you just sort of experiment until you get the results you want.
  
Again, this is [kind of like programming](programming) where you try something and see if it works. This repetition and experimentation is how humans acquire new skills, and both programming and film photography imbue this same learning philosophy.

Since the workshop, I've returned to the darkroom in Bushwick to print. My results aren't perfect, but I really enjoy the process. I can't say that printing in the darkroom gives me a better result than scanning and printing digitally – not yet anyway – but I definitely enjoy the process more. I feel a deeper sense of ownership over the final product, too. I'm looking forward to entering in silver gelatin prints into next year's Artsy Salon.
