title: "Objective-C Resources"

<p>I had a reader contact me this week looking for a list of blogs that <em>I</em> follow for Objective-C advice. I had to dig through my Google Reader list for a while to come up with a filtered list, since some good resources like my friend <a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com">Jason's blog</a>, are great developer resources, but also serve as personal blogs. I think my site, as it exists today, would also fall into this "in-between" category, though I'm hoping to move it towards stricter technical material</p>

<p>This list is anything but complete, but I thought I'd publish a succinct set of resources with helpful Objective-C advice.</p>
