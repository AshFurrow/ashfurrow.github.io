<p>Some coworkers and I spent a few weeks exploring how to represent calendar data on iOS, as well as learn more about ReactiveCocoa. The results are an app we call <a href="http://labs.teehanlax.com/project/upcoming">Upcoming</a>. It's open source. </p>

<p>And we love it so much we made a video. </p>
