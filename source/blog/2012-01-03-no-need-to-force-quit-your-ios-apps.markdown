<import><p>There's a very technically in-depth piece by Fraser Speirs about how <a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2012/1/2/misconceptions-about-ios-multitasking.html" target="_blank">force-quitting recent apps on your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad is useless</a>. While quitting those apps (or rather, removing them from the recently-used list) is harmless, it's something that the user is worried about; it's a kind of cognitive friction imposed by the design of iOS' multitasking user interface.<!--more-->
Here's the thing: it doesn't matter if you tell people that they don't need to clear out their recently-used list because they're going to do it anyway. I used to explain it to people - technical people, too. I don't bother anymore. The conversation would go something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Me: "You know you don't have to do that, right?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Them: "Yeah, you do, otherwise it's taking up battery life."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Me: "No, actually, the app is suspended and not using CPU cycles. The executable <em>may</em> be resident in memory, but it'll be freed if the OS needs the space, so it's not affecting battery or CPU performance at all."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Them: "Actually, I've found that I get <em>way</em> better battery life if I close them all. My friend found the same thing."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Me: "..."</p>
<p>I've had this conversation a lot, and it always ends with a personal anecdote about how, in reality, they're justified in their force-quit compulsion. It doesn't matter if it actually helps their phone's battery life, they <em>believe</em> it does.</p>
<p>They don't trust the software, which is rare in iOS.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Typically, I'm blaming RIM.</p>

Unlike Apple, who made sane architectural choices regarding multitasking in their OS, RIM just lets apps run in the background all willy-nilly until you restart the device by physically removing the battery. Seriously.</p>
<p>Way to go, RIM, now people don't trust their smartphones.</p>
<p>Of course, all the blame can't be placed on RIM since Apple could have and, in fact, should have come up with a better UI that makes it clear that recently-used apps aren't slowing down your phone or sucking up your battery. This needs to be fixed.</p></import>
