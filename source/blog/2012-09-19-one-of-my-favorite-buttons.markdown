<p><a href="http://fuckjetpacks.com/read/one_of_my_favorite_buttons">Great article</a> discussing the "Use Last Photo Taken" button in Tweetbot (hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/davegillis">David Gillis</a> for tweeting this).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it's fantastic interaction design all the same. It's this attention to detail, this relentless drive to add just a little more delight or remove a little pain, this tendency to never be satisfied with the status quo that can lead to great things.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I use this all the time. In fact, almost every time I upload a photo to Twitter, it's via that button. </p>

<p>It wasn't <em>difficult</em> to add that button. All the developer's had to do was give a damn. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonbrennan">Jason</a> wrote in to tell me it was actually Nevan Mrgan who suggested the idea last November, an idea to which Tapbots credited him.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Half-baked idea: iOS apps that display a photo-picking sheet, "Take Photo", "Choose Existing"? Add 3rd option, "Last Photo Taken". 95% case.</p>â€” Neven Mrgan (@mrgan) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgan/status/133311995125575681" data-datetime="2011-11-06T22:37:11+00:00">November 6, 2011</a>

<p>I guess in addition to giving a damn, it also helps to listen to your users. Turn out.</p>
