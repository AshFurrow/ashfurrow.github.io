<import><p>I'm having a good chuckle this morning over a bunch of Harvard professors up-in-arms over the university administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/us/harvard-e-mail-search-stuns-faculty-members.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">searching their email accounts</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I think what the administration did was creepy," said Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor, adding that "this action violates the trust I once had that Harvard would never do such a thing."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess what, professor J. Obvlivious, you don't <em>own</em> that email account. Your employer does. This goes for everyone, too. </p>

<p>Harvard legitimately searched emails for a the person who created a scandal that lead to to 70 students being forced to leave the school. This isn't a case of misuse of power, this is a case of "don't be a douchebag" and a lesson in keeping your private messages off your company email.</p></import>
