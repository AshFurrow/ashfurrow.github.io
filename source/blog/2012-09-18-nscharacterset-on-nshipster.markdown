<p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://nshipster.com/nscharacterset/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NSHipster+%28NSHipster%29">this week's NSHipster</a>. It discusses the uses, and misuses, of <code>NSCharacterSet</code> as well as a few other obscure-ish string-related classes.</p>

<p>If you don't already follow <a href="http://nshipster.com">NSHipster</a>, you really should. In the worst case, you already knew about the topic being discussed (but <em>you would</em> already have heard of that, wouldn't you?) and best case, you learn something super useful. </p>

  <p>And if not being wrong isn’t the most important thing about being an NSHipster, then I don’t want to be right!</p>
