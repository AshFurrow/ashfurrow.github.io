<import><p>Gruber said it right the other day. The time to start thinking about iOS 7 was a month ago. </p>

<p>I wrote an article about what app owners <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/migrating-to-ios-7/">need to do now</a> in order to be ready for day one. It's a tremendous opportunity, really, since Apple is likely to consider featuring you in your category. </p>

<p>This is also my first article ever to be linked to by <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/07/17/keeping-your-app-relevant-when-ios-7-is-released/">The Loop</a>, so it's something of a milestone for me. Onward and upward!</p></import>
