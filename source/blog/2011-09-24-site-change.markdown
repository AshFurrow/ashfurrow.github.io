<p>I re-ordered the links at the top of my site today.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to tell you this action was inspire out of a shift in the purpose of my site; that since I'm incredibly happy at my new job and I want people to be more interested in my writings than myself that I changed this blog to be a blog rather than a job recruiting tool.</p>

<p>But the sad fact is that the latest Wordpress update broke the hack they themselves recommend to have a static page <em>other</em> than your blog for the landing page.</p>

<p>My friend Jason <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jasonbrennan/status/116975447526473728" target="_blank">tweeted</a> (I can only assume this was directed at me) a link. <a href="http://shouldiusewordpress.com/" target="_blank">ShouldIUseWordpress.com</a>. I really have to learn Ruby on Rails.</p>
