## Feelings Matter

So I've [written about this before](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/empathetic-civilization/), but I'll say it again: _feelings matter_. It might sound obvious to you, but it really does need to be repeated. Compassionate software can't be built without compassion for each other.

Feelings matter, a lot. [We've actually researched this](http://qz.com/622749/teens-do-better-in-science-when-they-know-einstein-and-curie-also-struggled/): students who learned about the struggles that scientists went through on their way to achieving success did a lot better in science class. And students who _didn't_ learn did started doing _worse_.

Learning how successful scientists struggle helped students when they inevitably struggled. That's because struggling is normal, but when we neglect to mention the struggles of history's great scientists, we present the incorrect view that they just _were great_. And that's not true, [everyone struggles](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/normalizing-struggle/) sometimes.

When students see themselves and their own struggles represented in the history of science, they learn to _empathize_ with scientists. Empathy, the core of emotions, is the practice of sharing another person's point of view and feelings.

Empathy is a choice we make. In 1996, [Theresa Wiseman's work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1996.12213.x/full) ([PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Theresa_Wiseman/publication/227941757_A_concept_analysis_of_empathy/links/00b4951e409deac34f000000.pdf)) explained that there are four components to empathy:

- Seeing the world as others see it.
- Recognizing and understanding another's feelings.
- Staying non-judgemental.
- Communicating that you understand.

These are things we can do, things we can _choose_ to do. We can practice, we can set a Google Calendar reminder to reflect on recent meetings with the intent to empathize with our peers.

This is how someone empathizes, which is core to feelings, which matter. Feelings are important. Now I want to explore what it means to be a member of a team where feelings are prioritized.

## Teams with Psychological Safety Perform Better

- Google spent five years trying to figure this shit out, eventually found a _single_ positively correlated thing with team success: psychological safety.
- Psychological safety is defined as
  > The belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.
- It makes sense, here are some examples: TODO.
- Reminder: this is data talking, not me, and not feelings. This is hard evidence.
- Psychological safety is observable in teams in two ways:
  - Conversational turn-taking.
  - Average emotional sensitivity.
- This really ought to be expected at your workplace. It should be expected by you and your colleagues, and by the company leadership because it makes business sense.
- Also(TODO: include this?), this isn't about being touchy-feely, this is about empathy. They're different because TODO and it matters because TODO.

## How to Implement Psychological Safety on Your Team

- Can be a differentiator to help attract/retain talent.
