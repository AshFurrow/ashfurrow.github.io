<import><p>I was driving Ashley home from her March Break trip to Nova Scotia (I met her mother halfway in Amherst) and we decided to make a stop in Moncton. We were walking around Champlain Place when I saw Colpitts Men's Wear. I had never been in before, but as luck would have it, they're having a sale.
It reminded me a lot of <a href="http://www.peterrobertsformen.com/index.html" target="_blank">Peter Roberts</a>, downtown Fredericton. I found a few good deals, and they have lots of (mostly Winter) stuff left. Most everything is on 60% off, which is a good deal even if it was out of my price range before the discount. If you're in the area over the next week, I'd recommend stopping by.</p></import>
