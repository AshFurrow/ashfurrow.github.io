<p>Startups. The industry seems to have a love-hate relationship with them. I've worked in a few, and am returning to the startup world next month. </p>

<p>I think one of the biggest problems with startups is the lack of diversity that's typical in a startup's ranks. Lack of diverse backgrounds leads to groupthought and a hive mind that makes bad decisions because it can't see the bigger picture. </p>

<p>This lack of diversity seems to be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/02/the-main-culprits-for-startups-diversity-problem-investors?CMP=twt_gu">caused by investors</a>. </p>

<p>Interesting. </p>

<p>Why just today I read another article about the <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2014/01/03/on-the-future-of-the-internet-and-everything/">future of the Internet</a>. Basically, worldwide internet usage will saturate around 2030, but its growth is projected to start slowing down in 2016. That's only two years away. Horace Dediu argues that this will lead to a scarcity in venture capitalist investors interested in the Internet. </p>

<p>That's interesting. I'm not sure really how I feel about the prospect of VCs not being interested in investing anymore. They seem like such a mainstay to the Internet economy. Then again, if its their (rather foolish) insistence that startups be comprised solely of completely devout, underpaid, over-worked code monkeys, maybe a lack of VC funding is exactly what the startup community needs. </p>
