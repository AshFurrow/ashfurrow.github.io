<p>God I am so done with <a href="http://getsharekit.com/" target="_blank">ShareKit</a>. I've never used Three20, so it may only be the <em>second</em>Â biggest steaming pile of shit on the Internet, but either way it sucks so hard. Using it is like banging your face in with a hammer. A hammer made of crushed dreams and melted iced cream that's been refrozen.<!--more-->
Why does it suck? Here're the top reasons:</p>

<ol>

<li>"Let's abstract ALL OF THE THINGS!!!!"</li>

<li>Shoddy memory management practices (<code>[self retain]</code>, anyone?)</li>

<li>"Let's cater to non-Objective-C developers! This certainly won't alienate anyone!"</li>

<li>"Let's not be transparent about how we work at all."</li>

<li>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">No</span> Poor documentation.</li>

</ol>

<p>Basically you're punished if you want to use ShareKit any other way than how the authors intended.</p>

<p>Fuck you, ShareKit. When I drop support for iOS 4 in my apps, a day that is quickly approaching, you're getting kicked to the curb so fucking hard.</p>
