<p>Recently, I blogged about <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/index.php/2011/10/code-idols/">Code Idols</a> and how I look up to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/u" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> creator <a href="http://www.marco.org/" target="_blank">Marco Arment</a>.
Well, just this last weekend, we at <a href="http://500px.com/" target="_blank">500px</a> released <a href="http://500px.com/ipad" target="_blank">our new iPad app</a> to tremendous applause. It had been 7 weeks in the making and a lot of fun. Already, within 4 days of launching, we were at the #34 spot for free iPad apps. <em>All of them</em>.</p>

<p>We're currently beating Google Earth, "Find my iPhone", and Netflix in terms of free app downloads. <em>In four days</em>.</p>

<p>But what I'm most proud of is that my app is being featured beside Marco's, who holds the #34 spot for the paid category. Awesome.</p>
