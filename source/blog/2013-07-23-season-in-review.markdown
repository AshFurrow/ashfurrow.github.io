I am not a sportsfan, but I enjoy solving interesting problems with creative people. That's why I'm very excited to show off [Season in Review](http://labs.teehanlax.com/project/season-in-review), the latest T+L Labs project I've been working on.

It was a really fun project â€“ combining stats data together with an interested UI design. I implemented everything using ReactiveCocoa, natch. Nothing about the implementation beyond that is that technically interesting. What _is_ interesting is that my involvement in the project didn't end with implementation.

I shot the original concept video (which we later reshot with the talented visual designers at T+L) and I also contributed video editing (new for me), audio editing, and photography. I can't imagine working anywhere else and getting to flex my creative muscles in quite the same way.
