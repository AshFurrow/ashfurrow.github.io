<import><p>TNW has an interesting breakdown on some fairly shocking news about Android malware. They <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/10/25/in-one-year-android-malware-up-580-23-of-the-top-500-on-google-play-deemed-high-risk/">contextualize the news of the skyrocketing amount of Android malware</a> apps by pointing out most of those apps aren't available through Google Play. These malware apps are only on third party app markets. </p>

<p>Here's my problem with this analysis.</p>

<p>Having 175 worldwide Android markets is <em>important</em> for Android to be "open", even if the overwhelming majority of the malware comes from those non-Google markets. </p>

<p>Makes sense, I guess.</p>

<p>Then there is this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android is a relatively new platform, so of course malware numbers are skyrocketing, because so are total app numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Of course</em>. Because malware is, like, unavoidable, right?</p>

<p>I can think of another app platform whose number of apps is skyrocketing while the number of malware apps continues to hover around zero.</p></import>
