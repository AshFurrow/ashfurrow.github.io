<import><p>A while ago, I posted a how-to guide on <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/2012/02/how-to-host-useful-projects-on-github/">hosting useful projects on GitHub</a>. The post centred around the idea that you should make your code easy to integrate into an existing project and supply a demo project that is neither too tightly, nor too loosely, coupled to the project a developer would be using.</p>
<p>Well, it's time for me to eat my own medicine to check how my latest foray into open source software stacks up.</p>
<p>I've been writing an <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/500px-iOS-api" target="_blank">Objective-C wrapper for the 500px API</a>, and I'm quite proud of it. I'm hoping to inspire iOS and OS X developers to make apps with casual 500px integration, much like the way most apps have integration with Twitter or Facebook. It's still early in its development, but I've already had some positive feedback from real-world, third party developers using our API.</p>
<p>What I'm most proud of, however, is the README. I worked really hard to make sure that incorporating this project is a drop-and-go experience, so developers focus on making their apps instead of fighting with their development environment. I include instructions for using git submodules to get updates to the code, screenshots showing developers what to do,  and an example project showing how to use the different basic features of the library. </p>
<p>Check it out, and if you have any recommendations or complaints, please do let me know.</p></import>
