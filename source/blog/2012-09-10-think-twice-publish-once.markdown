<p>Oh, look, a giant shit storm is brewing on the Internet. HP released a new, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/10/hp-spectre-one-all-in-one-envy-20-envy-23-pavilion-20/">obvious knock-off</a> of the iMac.</p>

<p>Marco Arment is upset about the <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/09/10/elephant">coverage The Verge</a> is giving the computer because their article doesn't draw attention to its obviousness knock-offness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maintaining these relationships while retaining credibility isn’t always an easy choice for many sites, and many choose poorly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/10/marco-design">linked to</a> Marco's post, while adding the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it’s about not pissing off the vocal anti-Apple contingent of their readerships</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Why bother, after all?</p>

<p>Topolsky <a href="http://joshuatopolsky.com/post/31285353423/integrity-and-bullies-with-blogs">responds</a>, calling bullshit (and he's kind of right). However, he's pissed off, taking it as personally as I would, and arguably going a little far.</p>

<p>Then, of course, Marco <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/09/10/bullies-with-blogs">responds back</a>, claiming that Topolsky is personally attacking him.</p>

<p>Here's the key thing about Topolsky's post, though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously people rip off Apple. It is not news.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Verge reports <em>news</em> and <em>everyone knows</em> that everyone rips off Apple. The Verge has no stake in pissing off its readership, Gruber is right. However, The Verge isn't avoiding the issue out of a sense of appeasement; they just don't have a stake in this fight, so why bother?</p>

<p>Of course, now here we're in a massive pile of vitriol and bloggers. </p>

<p>Did this have to happen? Of course not. </p>

<p>What we say on the Internet <em>matters</em>. This is not an abstract space entirely without consequences. It's easy to forget that. </p>

<p>People will take things personally, and I would have thought that everyone in this situation would have realized that. Maybe next time we can all just cool off before hitting the "Publish" and needlessly hurting someone's feelings. </p>

<p>Or maybe I'm just being too Canadian. Can't we all be friends?</p>
