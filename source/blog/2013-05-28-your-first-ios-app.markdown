<import><p>So I finished my awesome crowdfunded, stick-it-to-the-man, self-published book. Whew! 208 pages of pure iOS goodness. </p>

<p>I'm giving away the <a href="http://yourfirstiosapp.com">first chapter for free</a>, licensed under Creative Commons.  You can also <a href="https://leanpub.com/your-first-ios-app">buy my book</a> directly. It'll be up on Amazon eventually. </p>

<p>Please help spread the word â€“ the more the merrier!</p></import>
