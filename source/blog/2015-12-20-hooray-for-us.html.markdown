So Canada's been really excited, eh? We've got a new, dreamy prime minister and [some shockingly awesome policies](http://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/12/07/news/canada-shocks-cop21-big-new-climate-commitment) to match. One of the things we've been _most_ excited about is that Canada has welcomed its first Syrian refugees.

[Yay, welcoming refugees!](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/12/11/syrian-refugees-arriving-at-pearson-tonight-but-well-wishers-asked-to-stay-home.html) We've got Prime Minister Trudeau [greating refugees](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/12/11/first-flight-of-syrian-refugees-expected-to-arrive-today-in-toronto_n_8767700.html) with a great speech:

We've got a welcome banner on the front-cover of the Toronto Star:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thursday&#39;s cover on Toronto Star &quot;Welcome to Canada&quot;&#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/TorontoStar">@TorontoStar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash">#WelcomeToCanada</a> <a href="https://t.co/hlIIqg1e9F">pic.twitter.com/hlIIqg1e9F</a></p>&mdash; Everett Coldwell (@EverettColdwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/EverettColdwell/status/675181922088275969">December 11, 2015</a></blockquote>

Heck, we've even got school kids writing letters to newly arrived refugees!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Welcome to Canada!&quot; Kids&#39; handwritten cards for Syrian refugees will warm your heart: <a href="https://t.co/yrz2JhNBEo">https://t.co/yrz2JhNBEo</a> <a href="https://t.co/QMa5b5Nugj">pic.twitter.com/QMa5b5Nugj</a></p>&mdash; TorontoStar (@TorontoStar) <a href="https://twitter.com/TorontoStar/status/672410015215566848">December 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

Even my own home province of New Brunswick – a province _not_ typically known for its progressive politics – is excited to welcome refugees:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s an honour to welcome our newest NBers to the province today. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeRefugeesNB?src=hash">#WelcomeRefugeesNB</a> <a href="https://t.co/LX4AcFqSb0">pic.twitter.com/LX4AcFqSb0</a></p>&mdash; Government of NB (@Gov_NB) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gov_NB/status/678334439521452032">December 19, 2015</a></blockquote> 

Canada's recent election was [heavily influenced](http://globalelectioninsights.ca/federal/refugee-crisis-what-are-countries-doing-about-it/) by party leaders' stances on Syrian refugees. Trudeau's stance on accepting refugees played a role in his success at the polls.

How cool is that? Canada was tired of Harper being a dick, so as soon as we could, we elected a charming PM who promised to make Canada a better global citizen. Yay democracy!

From my perspective (admittedly, in my New York apartment), Canada seems pretty excited to start acting like decent, civilized people again. And good for us.

However...

I think it's important to acknowledge that, to some degree, these refugees are being used. 

Used? What does that mean? Well it means that other people are taking advantage of the situation for their own ends.

This isn't new, and it certainly shouldn't be news. Think about it: Trudeau has used their circumstances to gain political favour, news outlets have used photos and videos of refugees to make content, and as a country, Canada is using them (I believe) to soothe our collective guilt about ever having elected Harper.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I share the pride of our community as we welcomed refugees from Syria to Fredericton @fredairport <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeRefugees?src=hash">#WelcomeRefugees</a> <a href="https://t.co/CQtUKDDtCQ">pic.twitter.com/CQtUKDDtCQ</a></p>&mdash; Matt DeCourcey (@MattDeCourcey) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattDeCourcey/status/678312666335678465">December 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

Don't get me wrong – I really am ecstatic that Canada is welcoming refugees. And our society says that it's acceptable for Trudeau et al are using refugees to their advantage. Politicians use stunts like this all the time – instead of kissing babies, Trudeau is helping refugees' children into their new winter coats. 

There is a definite line between refugees being _used_ and refugees being _exploited_. The question is, then, where is that line?

I worry.

I worry that if we're not careful, we'll find ourselves treating these people's upended lives as spectacle.

It's important to remember that, like other western nations, Canada has benefited from the events that led to refugees fleeing their homes. Accepting refugees is not something to get excited about; it is a woeful obligation. It is something carried out by countries as a consequence of their failure to end global conflict and inequality.

There is a bigger picture here. Yes, of course we have a humanitarian duty to accept refugees, but we also have a duty to build a future where people _don't have_ to flee conflicts in their home countries.

I am _super-excited_ that we're accepting refugees. "[Canada's Back!](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/20/trudeau-election-campaign_n_8331266.html)" But I don't want us to loose sight of the global perspective: as a nation – hell, as a species – we need to work _way_ harder towards a future where there _are no more refugees_.

Overemphasizing our positive actions is a problem; focusing solely on welcoming refugees draws our attention away from the situations that lead them here.
