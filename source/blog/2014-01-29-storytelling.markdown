I was reminded today by my friend [Eric](http://twitter.com/akaoka) of Ira Glass' advice on storytelling. I'll let it speak for itself.

I've launched a few projects, many recently, and Ira Glass' advice really speaks to me.

I rely on the open source community for a lot of what makes my projects good: by exposing my ideas to others, they become better ideas. People attribute that to me, but I'm telling you I'd be nowhere if it weren't for the people around me.

Coincidentally, I'm launching a thing soon. Yeah, I'm nervous, but I'm confident it'll work out in the end.
