<p>I was reminded today by my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/akaoka">Eric</a> of Ira Glass' advice on storytelling. I'll let it speak for itself. </p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe data-image-dimensions="1280x720" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/24715531?wmode=opaque&amp;api=1" width="1280" data-embed="true" webkitallowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" title="Ira Glass on Storytelling" height="720" class="embed-responsive-item"></iframe></div>

<p>I've launched a few projects, many recently, and Ira Glass' advice really speaks to me. </p>

<p>I rely on the open source community for a lot of what makes my projects good: by exposing my ideas to others, they become better ideas. People attribute that to me, but I'm telling you I'd be nowhere if it weren't for the people around me. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, I'm launching a thing soon. Yeah, I'm nervous, but I'm confident it'll work out in the end. </p>
