<import><p>My friend Rob Rix has done an excellent job presenting <a href="https://github.com/robrix/Postmodern-Programming">Postmodern Programming</a> at CocoaConf. While I wasn't there to see it in person, his presenter notes are online. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would highly recommend reading them over. </p></import>
