<import><p>I listened to the <a href="http://attentionsurplus.ca/post/47081847903/taking-the-leap">latest episode of my friend's podcast</a> the other day and its story really resounded with me. The episode tells the tale of a man who left his life behind to explore India and how that didn't really work out very well for him. </p>

<p>One of the key parts of the message was near the end: that running away from something because it's difficult is the easy way out. The difficult thing isn't taking a leap and finding yourself – the difficult thing is staying where you are and working to improve your situation. The point was that the man thought he was running <em>toward</em> something new, but he was really running <em>from</em> where he was. </p>

<p>I recently quit my job at an established Toronto startup and started a new job at a well-known digital agency. Since listening to the podcast episode, I've been reflecting on my choices, the actions I took because of those choices, and the motivation behind them. To be completely honest, I was running from a situation, but only after trying everything I could to improve it. However, I was also running to a company that I knew I wanted to work for. </p>

<p>I'm proud of the choices I made and how I handled the situation. That'll be my motivation the next time I have to make a difficult decision – any difficult one. Will I be proud of this decision in three months, or will I regret it? </p></import>
