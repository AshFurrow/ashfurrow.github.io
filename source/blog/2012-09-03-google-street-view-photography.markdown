<import><p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/nanoinfinity">Sam</a> linked to a <a href="http://9-eyes.com">really interesting project</a> that <a href="http://jonrafman.com">Jon Rafman</a> has done to collection Google Street View images as a work of artful photography. </p>

<p>Google Street View obviously isn't photography; it's just a fleet of vans capturing a photo of every roadway in the world (no big deal). However, when you take this spaghetti-against-the-wall approach and combine it with the kind of careful curation Jon Rafman has performed, I think you produce a kind of art. </p>

If someone hadn't have gone looking for this, no one would have captured this really interesting moment in time.</p>

This photo emerged through an automated, mechanical process, but represents something more when we <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0579531/quotes">imbue</a> it with meaning.</p></import>
