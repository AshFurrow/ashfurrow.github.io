On my way down to San Francisco for WWDC, I saw a really cool tweet. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">52 people every <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS?src=hash">#iOS</a> developer should follow on Twitter - great list by <a href="https://twitter.com/pawel_bialecki">@pawel_bialecki</a> <a href="https://t.co/yBKZPqdP0t">https://t.co/yBKZPqdP0t</a></p>&mdash; NatashaTheRobot (@NatashaTheRobot) <a href="https://twitter.com/NatashaTheRobot/status/607291623861547008">June 6, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Cool! So I check out the list and I'm pleased to discover that I'm actually included in it. Neat!

But I did notice that most of the 52 members of the list were white dudes. 

Other people noticed, too. 

<!-- more -->

People noticing this is _awesome_ – we need to be aware of the lack of diversity in our industry and our community and we should call out problems like this when we see them. And there's a way to be constructive when giving criticism, a way to make things better.

One of my friends was being quite negative, so I tried to turn that frustration into positive action.

"Let's make a new list, an awesome list, of diverse industry awesome people!" 

My friend correctly pointed out the inappropriateness of me, a white dude, making a list of underrepresented iOS people. That's a great point. 

But that doesn't mean the idea itself is bad – it means that we need help from other people. We need members of underrepresented groups to help us. So I asked my friend if he would help me find some people to help us. 

No joy. My friend said he was happy to signal boost members of underrepresented groups, but that's it. 

I'm not sure how I feel about that. 

I mean, think about it. You're in tech and you're a not a white cishet dude. Your life and your career are already more difficult than average, but now on top of that, some white dudes expect you to singlehandedly try to fix the diversity problem in tech _and then_ they'll signal boost you. 

It must be exhausting. To experience all the problems of the tech world and then _also_ be expected to be a role model to every other member of ever underrepresented group who might someday get into tech. 

That's a lot of responsibility. 

I think it's important to remind ourselves that some people just want to do their jobs, and that should be OK. It should be OK to just wants to make apps without having extra responsibilities to try and fix tech's problems. Responsibilities no one really places on white cishet men.

It's unreasonable to require members of underrepresented groups to pull themselves out of the mess they're in without any help. We can't expect them to do it alone. 

So what I'm saying is, I want to make a list of awesome people in iOS who aren't white dudes. Are there any people who are not  white cishet men out there who have some time to help me make a list? You can stay totally anonymous and back out at any time. If you identify as a member of an underrepresented group in tech, [let me know](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com) who you admire.
