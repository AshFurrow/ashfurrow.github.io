On my way down to San Francisco for WWDC, I saw a really cool tweet. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">52 people every <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS?src=hash">#iOS</a> developer should follow on Twitter - great list by <a href="https://twitter.com/pawel_bialecki">@pawel_bialecki</a> <a href="https://t.co/yBKZPqdP0t">https://t.co/yBKZPqdP0t</a></p>&mdash; NatashaTheRobot (@NatashaTheRobot) <a href="https://twitter.com/NatashaTheRobot/status/607291623861547008">June 6, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Cool! So I check out the list and I'm pleased to discover that I'm actually included in it. Neat!

But I did notice that most of the 52 members of the list were white dudes. 

Other people noticed, too. 

<!-- more -->

People noticing this is _awesome_ â€“ we need to be aware of the lack of diversity in our industry and our community and we should call out problems like this when we see them. And there's a way to be constructive when giving criticism, a way to make things better.

One of my friends was being quite negative, so I tried to turn that frustration into positive action.

"Let's make a new list, an awesome list, of diverse industry awesome people!" 

My friend correctly pointed out the inappropriateness of me, a white dude, making a list of underrepresented iOS people. That's a great point. 

But that doesn't mean the idea itself is bad. It means we need to make sure the actual voices of underrepresented people are heard, and not our own. 

Let's do something. Let's make a list of awesome people in iOS who aren't white dudes. Are there any people who are not  white cishet men out there who have some time to help make a list? You can stay totally anonymous and back out at any time. If you identify as a member of an underrepresented group in tech, [let me know](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com) who you admire.
