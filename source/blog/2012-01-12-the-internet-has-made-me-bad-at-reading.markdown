<import><p>The Internet has made me really bad at reading. There's always such an abundance of things I <em>could</em> read that I need to selectively filter what I choose to (because my time, like everyone's, is finite and valuable). The unfortunate reality is that I find myself reading <em>more</em> articles, but only skimming them. <!--more-->
Take this article I found on Hacker News this morning: <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2012/01/i-keep-forgetting-to-use-your-app.html" target="_blank">I keep forgetting to use your app</a>. It's apparently about mobile app development and probably about use experience, but I'm not reading it. It has no pictures, no diagrams, and the layout doesn't grab my attention, so I closed the tab after skimming only the first paragraph.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just that the paragraph didn't pull me in and tell me what the full article was about. Maybe I'm over-reacting to an Internet full of people who aren't great at writing compelling blog posts (gasp!), but I feel in some ways that my attention span has been reduced; I feel like because there's always something to read, I never take the time to read and reflect on anything in any amount of depth. And I kind of hate it.</p></import>
