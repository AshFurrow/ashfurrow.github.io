<p>I'm very happy to share <a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2013/12/my-favorite-cocoa-programming-blogs/">Ole Begemann's list of favourite Cocoa blogs</a>. Very happy not solely because it's a great list of blogs, but because <em>this</em> blog made it onto the list. </p>

<p>I know I didn't do as much writing here as I wanted to in 2013, but I'm looking forward to doing more of it, and more open source contributions, in the coming twelve months. Cheers!</p>
