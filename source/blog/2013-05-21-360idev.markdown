<p>Use of open source code is quite common, but the tools don't support or encourage developers to use it â€“ I'm looking at you, Xcode. I'm going to be presenting some different techniques to avoid the pitfalls of using open source software when developing OS X and iOS apps. </p>

<p>If you're attending 360iDev, I'd love to meet you. If you're not attending, I'd encourage you to do so. It's going to be a lot of fun.</p></import>
