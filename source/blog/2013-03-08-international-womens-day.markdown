<p>Today is <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com">International Women's Day</a>, whose theme this year is "gaining momentum." While geek culture and the IT workplace are still rife with an abundance of sexist attitudes and practices, I have seen more and more individuals stand up to them lately. It's inspiring to see such positive change happen in your own community. </p>

<p>However, not everyone agrees. Not everyone understands the implications of feminism – that it's not about disempowering men, but rather about empowering women. </p>

<p>In this video, Anita Sarkeesian shows how biased video game storytelling is in favour of the objectification of women. This isn't about taking away from male video game characters – it's about pointing out how video games, which are played during crucial developmental years of a child's life, reinforce the concept that women are objects to be acted upon. </p>

<p>Men benefit from the feminist movement as well.</p>

<p>In this vide, Tony Porter describes his "man box" theory: a collection of stereotypes and expected behaviours <em>of men</em>. It really sucks to live outside this box. If the box weren't there – if feminism was successful and these expectations were lifted – it would make mens' lives easier, too. </p>

<p>Feminism isn't about anything other than equality for everyone. The sooner we get there, the better.</p>
