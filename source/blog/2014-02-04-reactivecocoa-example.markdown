<import><p>The Big Nerd Ranch blog has a <a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/4549-data-driven-ios-development-reactivecocoa/">great post</a> detailing an example of how to use ReactiveCocoa in a non-trivial way (that is, real-world use). They do so by using a project to explain the motivation behind ReactiveCocoa. Really great stuff. </p>

<p>(Full disclosure: I helped them proof the article.)</p></import>
