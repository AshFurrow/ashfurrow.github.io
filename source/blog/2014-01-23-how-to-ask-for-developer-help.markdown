<p>I've written four books and dozens of tutorials and sample code projects, so I get a bit of questions from readers over email. I love hearing from people and getting questions, and I make it very easy to get in touch with me. </p>

<p>Often, people have a question about something technical. Most developers are more than happy to help if they can, but one-to-one help doesn't scale well. Chances are if one person has a question, someone else has it too. If the conversation stays in email, then others can't benefit from the answer. </p>

<p>Instead, I recommend posting a question to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, listing <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/">what you've tried</a> so far and any applicable sample code. The more information you provide, the easier it is for the community to help you. </p>

<p>Open source your question so they can open source the answer.</p>
