<import><p>I've long been believer in the idea that the best marketing you can do for a product is to ensure the quality of that product. Make something awesome and people will buy it, provided there's a market for that product. </p>

<p>With that said, I've very happy to announce that my book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/iosfrp/">Functional Reactive Programming on iOS</a>, has broken 500 readers. </p>

<p>When I started writing this book, I didn't know if there would be a sufficient demand. I hoped, but I wrote it without knowing for sure. Now, having completed it and seeing the results in sales, I can confirm my belief both that there would be a market, and that if you make it awesome, they will come. </p>

<p>This gets back to my discussion about <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/quality">quality</a> from the other day. My podcast suffered a decline in listeners last month. I don't know why, maybe it was just the Christmas holidays. Maybe it was a natural waning of listeners because the quality wasn't there. </p>

<p>I've committed myself to only making awesome stuff. That aligns with my new job in Amsterdam, with my open source contributions, and a super-secret project I can't talk about yet. Wink wink. </p></import>
