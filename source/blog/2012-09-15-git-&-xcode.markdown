<import><p>I got a new MacBook Air from work yesterday. The command line tools of Xcode weren't transferred over from my old machine, so when I typed <code>git status</code>, nothing happened.</p>

<p>Hrm.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ndfred">Frédéric Sagnes</a> sent me <a href="http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/07/you-dont-need-the-xcode-command-line-tools/">this Cocoanetics</a> article explaining how git is contained <em>inside Xcode</em> and you don't need to install the command line tools at all. Further, the git version in Xcode is <em>newer</em> than the one in the command line tools.</p>

<p>Enter the following command into the Terminal to get the latest and great git version that Xcode is running itself.</p>

<pre><code>echo alias "git=xcrun git" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></import>
