<p>I just read an <a href="http://taybenlor.com/2013/05/21/designing-for-ios.html">interesting and thorough guide to iOS Design</a> â€“ it's well worth checking out. It's a very concise distillation of Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Introduction/Introduction.html">Human Interface Guidelines</a> with fantastic graphics illustrating the different points it makes. </p>

<p>Definitely something to keep in your bookmarks folder as a quick reference. </p>
