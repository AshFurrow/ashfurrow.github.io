<import><p>My friend <a href="https://alpha.app.net/zev">Zev</a> maintains a <a href="https://github.com/ZevEisenberg/ios-convenience">great library</a> for fixing Xcode's code snippets behaviour to put new brace brackets on their own line. </p>

<p>He's also got a section of his <code>.zprofile</code> in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ZevEisenberg/5167026">gist</a> so he can type <code>fixXcode</code> and it'll clone the repo and do everything for you. Like magic.</p>

<p>He sent it to be, and I was hesitant at first because it involves using <code>zsh</code> instead of <code>bash</code>. I mean, only nerds use <code>zsh</code> right?</p>

<p>Right!</p>

<p><code>zsh</code> has autocomplete for git. That is <em>all</em> you need to know to switch. </p></import>
