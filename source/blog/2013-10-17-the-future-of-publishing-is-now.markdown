<import><p><a href="http://www.robertnewman.com/the-future-of-publishing-is-now/">Interesting article</a> I read this morning about the future of publishing and publishers. </p>

<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again now: the needs and desires of traditional media outlets are not congruent or compatible with the needs and desires of individuals or small teams working to publish something. Yesterday, <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/35mm-launch">I became a publisher</a>, and this has dramatically changed the way that I read articles like this one. </p>

<p>One thing that stood out to me as incredible obvious, but apparently needed to be said, is that your readers are a community and you should engage with them. Our editor, designer, and myself have been active in accruing participation from our audience. </p></import>
