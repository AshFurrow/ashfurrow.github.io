<p>I'm going to be at WWDC 2013 next week. I land Saturday and leave the following Saturday. Normally I'd say if you're in the area, we should get together for a beer. However, my week is super busy this year. </p>

<p>On Monday, the tenth, I'll be speaking about ReactiveCocoa at the <a href="http://spotifywwdc2.splashthat.com">Spotify WWDC Developer Meetup</a> before heading to the Crashlytics party. Tuesday, I'll be juggling the ReactiveCocoa meeting at the Square offices before going to the <a href="http://wwdcparties.com/details.php?id=1ff0b0559c594c76d2d087b33b68d5bb">App Camp for Girls Happy Hour</a>. Finally, on Wednesday, I'll be speaking at <a href="http://wwdcparties.com/details.php?id=48946f1f845aee1e5e46ce92d8a8b224">Pivotal Labs</a> on a panel discussing reactions to the keynote and the future of iOS. </p>

<p>If you're attending any of these events, please say hi. Nerd parties are always awkward, but if we're awkward together, it'll work itself out. </p>
