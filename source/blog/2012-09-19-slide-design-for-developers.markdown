<import><p>As I worry about my approaching <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=134&amp;presentation_id=2044">FITC presentation</a>, I'm pretty ecstatic to have Adam working on the slides for the presentation. A real designer - this presentation is really going to stand out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I found <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/">Holman's guide to Slide Design</a> to be very helpful in terms of <em>presentation design</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best jazz soloists are capable of starting a melody, repeating it, and then playing with it after the audience has identified with the repetition. The best storytellers will repeat the same line throughout a story to build a sense of familiarity, of excitement. </p>

<p>I'm actually accomplished as at saxophone jazz improvisation. This might not be so hard after all :)</p></import>
