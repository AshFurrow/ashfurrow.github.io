<p>Here's an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13248493/detect-ipad-mini-in-html5">interesting Stack Overflow question</a> from a web developer trying to differentiate between an iPad 2 and an iPad mini.</p>

<p>Oh, fuck off. </p>

<p>The poster's justification is that proper design adjusts the size of hit targets (buttons and links). You don't need to dynamically resize hit targets - Apple has <em>not</em> included a way to distinguish the devices because you shouldn't. Just make everything at least 44 logical pixels (or <em>points</em> in Objective-C) wide and tall and it will be usable on either device. </p>

<p>Follow the rules and don't fuck around. Can I have that 500 point bounty now?</p>
