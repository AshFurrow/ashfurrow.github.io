<p>Yesterday evening, I wrote a post about what are essentially <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/index.php/2011/02/obsession-with-jfk/">style-snobs</a>. Jason Brennan <a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/ash_furrow_on_style">asked</a> if I read something called <a href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a>. I hadn't, but I've been reading through it now :)</p>

<p>This led to <a href="http://putthison.com/post/2108812491/q-and-answer-where-can-i-get-good-advice-on-mens">this post</a> about where to get advice. They have some thoughts about these snobs and concluded that style is what you make of it. It cautions that the people who typically blog about style are enthusiasts and they spend their time and money one their passion. As an avid coffee-lover, I can relate.</p>

<p>I really like this site; it offers a lot of sound, sensible, and accessible advice. A lot of sites will say something like "don't bother paying anything less than $2000 or a watch", where this site instead says "don't pay more than $50 for a Quartz watch."</p>
