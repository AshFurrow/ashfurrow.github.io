<p>Brent Simmons has a fantastic <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/12/31/coders_in_the_hands_of_an_angry_god">reponse post</a> to my earlier <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/seven-deadly-sins-of-modern-objective-c">deadly Objective-C sins</a> article. In it, he lists quite a few ones, and my favourites involve the static analylzer and compiler warnings: treat warnings as errors and turn on all the warnings. </p>

<p>Bam. </p>

<p>You're code just got, like, instantly more stable. Once you fix all the warnings, that is. </p>

<p>It's a fantastic list â€” anyone looking to improve their Objective-C chops this year would do well to read it.</p>
