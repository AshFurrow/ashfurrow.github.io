<import><p>I did a presentation on <code>UICollectionView</code> at <a href="http://tacow.org">TACOW</a> last night. The presentation is a little different than I normally do for a technical talk because I didn't go through the API, but rather focused on the three most important messages to remember when working with <code>UICollectionView</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>UICollectionView</code> is just like <code>UITableView</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>UICollectionView</code> separates dequeuing logic from display and layout.</li>
<li>
<code>UICollectionView</code> makes complex layouts easy.</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn't go over the minutiae of how to use them because there is the documentation for that. I focused on the what rather than the how â€“ I tried to inspire my audience with what was possible instead of being tied down with implementation details.</p>
