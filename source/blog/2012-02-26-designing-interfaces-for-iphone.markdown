<p>I gave a presentation this morning at <a href="http://2012.podcamptoronto.com/" target="_blank">Podcamp Toronto</a> about designing interfaces for iPhone. The talk was a high-level description of how to organize and structure content in iPhone apps. The slides are available in <a href="http://static.ashfurrow.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/Designing_Interfaces_for_iPhone.key">Keynote</a> and <a href="http://static.ashfurrow.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/Designing_Interfaces_for_iPhone.pdf">PDF</a>.
Slides were created in Keynote, but I've exported to PDF, too. I can't guarantee the fidelity of the export. </p>

<p>Also, I release the slides under Creative Commons.</p>
