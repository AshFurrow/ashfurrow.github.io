<p>I gave a presentation this morning at <a href="http://2012.podcamptoronto.com/" target="_blank">Podcamp Toronto</a> about designing interfaces for iPhone. The talk was a high-level description of how to organize and structure content in iPhone apps. The slides are available <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/designing-interfaces-for-iphone">Here</a>.

<p>Also, I release the slides under Creative Commons.</p>
