<p>I gave a talk last night at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iOSToronto/">iOS Toronto</a> and had a great time. It's nice to get away from the computer and spend time with what my friend describes as "our people."</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="ee3aa460141e0130e3741231380e9611" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p>Those are the slides - if you have any questions, drop me a line.  Oh, and if you want to purchase the book mentioned in the slides, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430243686/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430243686&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashfur-20">head over to Amazon</a> :)</p>
