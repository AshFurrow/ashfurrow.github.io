<p>Over at the <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/192350/how-apples-obsession-with-google-is-hurting-apple/">Cult of Mac</a>, there's an article describing how Apple's obsession with Google is hurting Apple. </p>

<p>Specifically, the author is upset about the new iOS 6 Apple Maps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple put crapware on their most important product on purpose in order to screw a rival at the expense of users.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No one knows why Google is no longer providing the Maps application. It could have been Google that pulled or, or there could be some other reason. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company has also gotten into bed with both Twitter and Facebook on social networking, and doesn’t offer any out-of-the-box integration with Google+.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, <em>that</em> is what will kill Apple, their lack of Google Plus integration. Mmhmm. This is the point in the article I become convinced the author might be trying to get the attention of <a href="http://www.macalope.com">the Macalope</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all know the reason why Apple is doing these things. They’re more focused now on hurting Google than thrilling users, just like they were with Microsoft in the 90s.</p>
  
  <p>It sucks. And it’s a recipe for longterm failure.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Only time will tell. </p>

<p>In the meantime, making these kinds of assumptions is not the work of someone trying to write anything factual. </p>
