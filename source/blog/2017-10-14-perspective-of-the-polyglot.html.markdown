In 2015, [I wrote][2015] about my next steps in [Artsy's engineering career ladder][ladder]. I specified the steps that I would be focusing on, like multiplying effectiveness of cross-team work, having an obvious technical impact on the team's strategic trajectory, and being a prolific contributor to software projects within Artsy. I've made progress on all these points, to varying degrees, but that's not what I want to talk about.

Back then, after listing all the things I wanted to focus on, I casually mention some other items that I'd skipped.

> There are other, more technical things like "own a large scale and impact service" ...

In hindsight, I maybe treated these "technical things" as if they were inevitable and would just happen on their own accord. But just like the community-oriented qualifications, technical skills are things that I need to consciously practice to improve at. To some extent, I might have neglected them.

I mean, don't get me wrong. I made occasional contributions (mostly in Ruby), I built new open source tools (mostly in Ruby), I even rewrote my website (in Ruby). I stayed in my comfort zone, I didn't even learn Rails!

That changed about a year ago, when I talked to my manager about breaking outside of the iOS developer box. I told him that I wanted to contribute to mission-critical backend systems at Artsy, to help build web frontends written in weird and opinionated languages, to experiment with unproven technologies and evaluate them for the team.

It's been a slow process. I haven't just been learning new things, I've also been helping other team members contribute to Artsy's iOS code. It's in everyone's best interests – Artsy's and the engineers – to be capable of building software in all the various technologies Artsy uses. 

I was doing things like pairing on our Scala codebase, which was totally new to me, but also pairing on our iOS codebases, which I helped write.

My progress was stunted at times my setbacks in my depression treatment. Sometimes I would take a step forward, but then take two steps back. That sucked. I made progress where I could and tried to accept that developing new skills takes time.

One week I would work _only_ in some React frontend, or _only_ in a backend Rails server, or _only_ in iOS apps. Contributions to non-iOS codebases were minor at first; arduous pull requests that changed some button's text or added some field to a model object. I was making contributions but each one was a new, individual challenge.

Recently, things have been different. I usually make contributions to a few distinct projects a week. It's not that unusual for me to make contributions to a few distinct projects a day. I have sought out exposure to building new-to-me kinds of software, with new-to-me practices and new-to-me conventions. It was hard. It sucked. It ruled. I doubted myself a lot.

On the upside, learning language after framework after methodology helped develop my intuition and pattern-recognition. Now I can jump into a new and pretty quickly make meaningful contributions.

It. Feels. Amazing.

This week, I released a new version of Artsy's main iOS app, helped profile and limit GraphQL request complexity, tuned server logging, worked on a new feature on a Rails app, undertook a refactor in a Scala backend – all while keeping on top of my responsibilities to the open source community. Cool.

There's perspective that comes with experience in different programming languages. Not just languages: systems, communities, and contexts.

For example: when I step into another programming community, I have the opportunity to look back and see the iOS developer community from a distance. Sometimes I really like what I see. Sometimes I don't. I try to bring that perspective back with me and improve things. Perspective makes you do that.

The more I learn, the more I realize I have to learn. I make progress only to learn that the goal – my idealized developer – is even further away than I thought. Like Zeno, I'll never make it to a finish line. I don't think that feeling will ever change, but I'm learning to accept the fact that the finish line doesn't exist: [the journey is the reward][journey].
