This wasn’t the first time that tools have limited my ability to express my ideas on the web, but it was a catalyst for what you see today: a brand new website. </p>"

      <p>A few months ago, I felt something change. I remember it precisely: I asked a friend for advice designing a portfolio section of my website, and I couldn’t implement his suggestions. This wasn’t the first time that tools have limited my ability to express my ideas on the web, but it was a catalyst for what you see today: a brand new website. </p>

      <p>So to talk about how and why we arrived here, we need to go back a bit. (This is going to be a bit of a storytelling post.)</p>

      <p>It was Christmas break, 2009, when I sat in a dark basement typing on a computer. I was busy writing my first ever iOS app. Near the end of the process, when I was getting ready to submit, I realized that I would need a website. I registered one, coffeetimerapp.com, and set about trying to make a website. </p>

      <p>I knew that making a website was beyond my abilities, so I turned to iWeb. I whipped something together with screenshots and arrows and text typeset in Marker Felt and I threw it up on the web. </p>

      <p>That Summer, after winning a WWDC scholarship, I got a reputation around my university’s CS department as being an Apple guy (not <em>the</em> Apple guy, we had two others in the city). I decided I needed to have some presence on the web, beyond twitter. I was afraid to set up a full site, so I used what I already had. Some <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101118104908/http://coffeetimerapp.com/CoffeeTimer/Ash_Furrow.html">mangled artefacts are still online</a>. Laugh, but it got me contracting jobs while I was still studying. </p>

      <p>Time passed. I was writing on a now-defunct-and-don’t-look-for-it-you-won’t-find-anything blogger blog and I really liked it. Initially, I started it to have discussions about atheism (I am not even kidding). It was a great way for me to start writing, and would eventually lead to writing books. But it drifted into too personal of a thing for my tastes, and I decided I needed a blog on my own terms with my own name on it. A friend <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/professional-site">suggested Wordpress</a>, but I’d need a site and hosting and blah blah blah. It was too scary, so I did used my existing site and moved it to Wordpress (hosted on Dreamhost). </p>

      <img src="/img/blog/fresh-coat-of-paint/wordpress.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Eventually it became embarrassing as a professional to have your business cards read “coffeetimerapp.com”, so I purchased this domain and migrated the Wordpress install over. I <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/twitter-name-change">changed my name</a> on Twitter and <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/2011/09/site-change">struggled to administer the site</a>.</p>

      <p>So I graduated, got my first “real” job and everything was good. I had written a few articles that got picked up on Hacker News, installed some caching plugins, and struggled to maintain the Wordpress install. It wasn’t ideal, but it was good enough. </p>

      <p>Until one day, <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/moved-away-from-wordpress">my site got hacked</a>. It sucked, having your name on pages selling knock-off handbags. I needed a new site that could import my old posts. I chose Squarespace for a few reasons: it was easy and let me write in markdown, it let me focus on writing instead of design and upkeep (which I was still afraid of), and it would let me – at any point – export all my content. </p>

      <p>Bingo.</p>

      <img src="/img/blog/fresh-coat-of-paint/squarespace.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>I hopped on board and things were great. I continued to develop as a writer, grew my professional reputation, and didn’t worry about a thing. Over the next few years, through professional and hobby experience, and with the mentoring of many friends and colleagues, I learnt how to set up basic static websites on S3. I learnt about to use modern HTML and CSS (not the kind I played around with in high school). And I learnt about design. </p>

      <p>For a long time, I’ve wanted to have more control over my Squarespace site, but not in a way I knew a normal person would want to. Putting ads on the side – figuratively bolting them on to the site – was difficult and looked not great. I would grow frustrated with its options of displaying tweets or other embedded content – what works for <em>my</em> template would have to of course work for <em>every</em> template. </p>

      <p>These were pretty trivial concerns – nothing worth going back to Wordpress over. But then my friend gave me that advice for my portfolio – just another thing I couldn’t do, and a seed was planted. </p>

      <p>Squarespace recently came out with the <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/seven/">seventh version</a> of its product. I have always loved Squarespace, and this new released looked <em>awesome</em>. I <em>really</em> liked the “single page” features, and I found myself wishing that I could write some of my posts with those designs – those contemporary “Medium”-inspired, full-bleed designs. But I couldn’t. Not with Squarespace.</p>

      <p>I looked at myself – the same guy who had to use iWeb because making websites was “too scary” – and I thought “yeah, I can do this.” I now had the tools and experience to make my own site, hosted statically on S3 for minimum maintenance, and using a tool that let me write in markdown and have as much or as little control over styling as I felt like. </p>

      <img src="/img/blog/fresh-coat-of-paint/middleman.png" class="img-responsive">

      <p>That was a few weeks ago. I’ve been slowly pecking away at this blog, using the different tools that I had become familiar with. Ruby, Middleman, S3. I had to learn some new tools, or re-learn old ones. I used Bootstrap because why the heck wouldn’t you, and Middleman because I had used it before for my <a href="http://notificationcenter.tv">podcast’s website</a>. I found a <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/">free Bootstrap blogging template</a> and chose a <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/color/398CCC/Walton">nice shade of blue</a>. I listed my requirements beyond a basic blog – like syntax highlighting – and used libraries that provided that for me. </p>

      <p>I kind of just quickly smashed together a bunch of cool, open source tools, combined with some photos I’ve taken and sample content, and this site was born. </p>

      <p>The last step would be importing my content from Squarespace. Not too bad – I just wrote a ruby script to parse the exported XML file, download any Squarespace-hosted assets, reconfigure each post’s content to match new URLs, and that’d be it. If you had told me that a few years ago, I would have been terrified. </p>

      <p>(The script for transforming the Wordpress-compatible XML file into Middleman blog entries is <a href="https://gist.github.com/AshFurrow/ea1e354fba72bb4cc533">available online</a> for anyone else needing it.)</p>

      <p>So that’s where we are today: a new person, and a new website. Looking back at how my web presence has grown – and how I’ve grown – has given me a lot to think about. In the midst of a my depression, I’m able to objectively look at myself and say “I am pretty OK”, which is a big accomplishment for me right now. </p>

      <p>There are a few complications, of course. Amazon has a hard limit of 50 resource redirects, which I’ve used for the most popular posts on my blog. The RSS feed <em>should</em> automatically redirect, but you’ll likely see a few duplicate entries. </p>

      <p>All in all, I’m pretty happy with the results. I’ve now got the tools available to focus on my writing <em>and</em> use design as a new medium of self-expression. I’m looking forward to writing really cool posts that integrate form into their function in a way that I couldn’t express before. And currently I’ve just imported existing content – I’ll be updating things like my portfolio to introduce some slick new designs soon. </p>
