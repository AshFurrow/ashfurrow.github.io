There's a TV show called _Steven Universe_ that I highly recommend, to anyone. I'm rewatching it now and I've got some notes on what appeals to me in the show. Maybe it would appeal to you, too.

If you've never watched cartoons or maybe you have but did not enjoy them, I encourage you to set that aside and give _Steven Universe_ a try anyways. It's obviously a cartoon aimed at kids, but the metaphors in the show make it inclusive to folks from all kinds of different backgrounds. It's not a kids show as much as it is a show that is accessible _to_ kids.

_Steven Universe_ is an adventure dramedy that tells stories around a cast of believable characters, with hopes and flaws and motivations. The show also tells a long, drawn-out sci-fi about intergalactic beings that colonize planets for their raw materials.

So there are a few things that really stand out in the show. Here's a tl;dr list, continue reading for more details.

- Excellent pacing.
- Large stories told with restraint.
- Consistent and cohesive lore.
- Believable characters.
- A non-judgemental narrative style.

Let's go into detail!

## Pacing

_Steven Universe_ is a masterclass in pacing. The story takes place on a kind of slightly-alternate Earth and spans back thousands of years to a war. Through telling stories relating to that war, the characters are developed over 11-minute episodes. 

There are no filler episodes; each episode contributes to character development in some way, and usually ties in with the broader story. There are often 3–5 episode arcs that tie together, but each episode is a self-contained story. This is a nice balance between the episodic monster-of-the-week style and the Battlestar Galactica style where few episodes can be watched on their own.

## Lore

The lore and world building in _Steven Universe_ is remarkable in its consistency and cohesion with both the art and the plot. It builds upon itself, setting up a stable foundation upon which to grow the characters and tell their stories.

To give you a taste, here's a rough overview of the world (season one/two spoilers):

Gems are aliens. They are a kind of magic/technology hybrid and exist as small gemstones embedded in their "physical forms" – humanoid bodies. These bodies are "holograms but with mass" and the show has fun with that.

Gems don't age, they don't change, they are created and used for specific purposes and there is no escape from a rigid social hierarchy. And that brings us to the war.

The Gem War was began on Earth as a rebellion against Homeworld. Earth was being destroyed to serve the purposes of the Diamonds until Rose Quartz stopped them. Countless gems and humans were destroyed, but the resistance successfully fought off Homeworld's forces (for now). Only a few gems survived the last assault on Earth, and they have been living in isolation for thousands of years.

Eventually, Rose would meet Greg (a human). They fell in love and, eventually, decided to have a child. This was unprecedented – gems don't have children, they are grown artificially. Steven was born and the show focuses a lot on his struggle to be himself. Not a human, not a gem. Just Steven.

## Characters

Okay so the characters! The adolescent Steven lives with the gems leftover from the war, and is also raised by his father Greg.

Rose and Greg wanted to have a child, but Rose understood this would require a sacrifice. She would have to permanently give up her physical form to give birth – an analogue to dying during childbirth. Rose knew that the beginning of Steven's existence would mark the end of her own. Steven has her gemstone as his bellybutton.

So fast forward about twelve years: Steven is living with the gems and spends a lot of time with his father. The two groups don't really get along. Some of the gems blame Greg for Rose being gone, and they struggle with complicated feelings towards their roles in Steven's life.

And each gem has their own distinct origins. Greg has a backstory too. These are all explored in really interesting and thoughtful ways. Side-characters too! You will never see a character only once, they _always_ reappear. Here's a very very small example: in Season Two, we finally explore the origins of a side-character, and that origin story briefly features this gem:

Later, in Season Three, we meet the gem again learn more about her relationship to Rose.

## Non-judgemental Narratives

What I really dig about the show is how non-judgemental it is. No character is ever looked down upon for their abilities, stature, job, lifestyle, whatever.

Take Greg for example. Greg is a burnt-out wannabe rockstar who lives in his van parked beside the carwash (where he works). Rather than depicting Greg as being unable to care for Steven, the relationship between the two is caring and meaningful. The show celebrates how Greg overcomes challenges to support his son. Greg is probably my favourite character.
