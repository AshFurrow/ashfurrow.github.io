<p>The Government of Canada provides a <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/sred/" target="_blank">tax credit</a> for companies performing research and development. Last week, I had an interview with a gentleman who had me detail all of the research and development I had done in 2011 for 500px. (After hearing I'd be interviewed on this topic, my reaction was identical to the other developers' there: "well that's all I do is research and development." Indeed, after my interview, the interviewer had run out of time for the and had to reschedule another appointment for everyone else.)

<p>The interview was fun, in a sort of geeky way. The interview was interested in having me describe ways that I was clever about problems I solved; the cleverer, the better, and if I had to iterate to come up with good solutions and could show that existing solutions were inadequate for my needs, that'd be great. It's like asking a showoff to show off. But what really got to me was the distinction between <em>experimentation</em> and <em>trial and error</em>.</p>

<p>When asked how I came to use a particular strategy in the 500px iPad app, I originally answered "trial and error" but the interviewer corrected me. What I was doing was <em>experimentation</em>: I had a hypothesis, performed an experiment, and came to a conclusion with regards to that hypothesis, even if the conclusion was that the hypothesis was incorrect.</p>

<p>Research. Development.</p>

<p>Trial and error, on the other hand, involves trying something without any idea if it would work and then retrying if it doesn't, repeated until you succeed.</p>

<p>I understand Objective-C and Cocoa Touch well enough that, when asked to do something I have never done before, I can make a logical guess about how best to go about it. Then I try that approach to see if it works. It's the difference between an educated guess and blind luck.</p>

<p>If you're using <em>trial and error</em> and are a software developer, then you're not. You're actually a monkey trying to write Shakespeare.</p>
