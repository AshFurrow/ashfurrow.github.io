<import><p>My friends at Readability have released the 2.0 version of their reading application. You can download it from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v6zC">App Store</a>.</p>

I feel a sense of ownership of the product since I worked on it for a few months, and I hope it does well. I don't know if any of the code I wrote is still present in the product, but still :)</p></import>
