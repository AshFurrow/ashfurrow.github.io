<import><p>I read an interesting article this morning on how sentors' support of SOPA and PROTECT-IP is based on a <a href="http://danwin.com/2012/01/the-sopa-debate-and-how-its-affected-by-congresss-understanding-of-child-porn/" target="_blank">fundamental misunderstanding of the technology involved</a>. It's an interesting read and includes a video of a senator asking if Google can come up with a filter for child pornography, then why can't it detect copyright infringement? <!--more-->
There's a very simple, non-technical answer explaining why this is impossible.</p>
<p>He didn't listen to it.</p>
<p>He then asks, "why not hire some whiz kids out of college?"</p>
<p>The answer is simply that any college-educated engineer who is smart enough to build a system that can detect <em>any</em> type of copyright material <em>and </em>selectively take down that material from <em>any</em> website will also be smart enough to know that building this SOPATRON would be unethical. They would understand that SOPA is the product of big-business lobby groups trying to legislate their way into a future where their business models don't need to adapt to reality.</p>
<p>More than anything, I think <em>this</em> is why Reddit, Google, Facebook, et al are so opposed to SOPA. Yes, it will hurt their business, but their leaders also know that SOPA is the wrong thing to do.</p></import>
