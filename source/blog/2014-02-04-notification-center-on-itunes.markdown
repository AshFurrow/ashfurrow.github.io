<p>My new podcast, <a href="http://notificationcenter.tv">Notification Center</a>, has been added to the iTunes podcast directory <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/notification-center/id812164680">here</a>. As part of the iTunes catalogue, you should be able to find it and subscribe to it in your favourite third-party podcatcher. (At the moment, mine is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/network-podcasts-client/id723422355?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3v6zC">Network</a>). </p>

<p>Go check it out, subscribe, and leave a review. We'll be recording and releasing a new episode this weekend. </p>
