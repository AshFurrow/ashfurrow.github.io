<p>So I've updated my blog theme. It's been an incremental change since I began fiddling with the CSS a month ago. The biggest change, however, is turning commenting off.<!--more-->For reference, a stock install of this theme looks like this: </p>

<p>The only real functional change I've made is to remove commenting. Turning off comments became chic in the tech blogger world when <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/" target="_blank">Matt Gemmell switched comments on his blog off late November</a>. I did it because I'm tired of dealing with automatically approving comments and a growing amount of comment spam.</p>

<p>But it got me thinking.</p>

<p>I was discussing with my wife how, though Matt Gemmell only recently disabled comments, my friend and fellow tech blogger <a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com/" target="_blank">Jason Brennan</a> has never had comments enabled in the first place. I insinuated to her that Jason was just lazy, since he wrote his own blogging platform, and she replied with "well, yeah, you wouldn't either, would you?"</p>

<p>And she's right. If comments were disabled by default, I probably wouldn't have enabled them. If I was writing my own Rails blogger platform and I had to spend hours writing and maintaining code for comments, I <em>definitely</em> wouldn't have done it.</p>

<p>She pointed out how this is the "default" mode for the web, and she's right again. The web is for serving <em>documents</em>, after all. It takes a fair bit of work to get comments working, compared to just serving documents. I feel like many blogs have comments enabled just because, like I did.</p>

<p>I'm hoping, like my new CSS, that this change will bring a new look to this blog.</p>
