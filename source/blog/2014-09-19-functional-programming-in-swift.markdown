<import><p>Yesterday, I gave a talk at <a href="http://nsspain.com/2014/">NSSpain</a> titled "The Future of Functional Programming in Swift". Slides are up <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/the-future-of-functional-programming-on-ios">here</a> and the sample code is <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/NSSpain2014">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This was a kind of cool talk for me. I've been doing 50-60 minute presentations lately, but this was only 30. I had a lot to discuss in a short amount of time: I don't believe that functional programming (or any type of programming) should be taught in a vacuum. Context is <em>critical</em>. <strong>What</strong> is functional programming? <strong>Why</strong> is functional programming important? <strong>When</strong> should it be used? <strong>How</strong> do I get started? These are questions that I tried to answer in my talk. </p>

I tried to infuse a sense of humour into my presentation, though I don't think many people got my Carl Sagan reference. About the first half was setting up context and the remainder was going through example code in an Xcode playground (sidenote: <em>super</em> awesome tool for teaching, thanks Apple!). Despite one <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/NSSpain2014/issues/2">small probem</a>, things went really well. </p>

<p>I think (?) the talk was recorded, so if it gets posted by the conference organizers, I'll put it up here. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know. </p></import>
