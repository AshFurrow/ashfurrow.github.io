<p>Recently, CoffeeScript bumpbed Objective-C off the <a href="http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2014/05/02/github-language-trends-and-the-fragmenting-landscape/">top-ten list of languages</a> used on GitHub. What a shame. Let's use this as an opportunity to show the rest of the developer community that Objective-C developers care about open source, too.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 29th, open an Objective-C repository or fork an existing one. Maybe publish some snippets to GitHub gists. Finished or in-progress, doesn't matter. All that matters is releasing code and having fun. </p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://openobjectivec.eventbrite.com">EventBrite</a> page for a reminder. </p>
