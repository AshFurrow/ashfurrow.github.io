<import><p>I've (finally) finished my book on ReactiveCocoa, <a href="https://leanpub.com/iosfrp">Functional Reactive Programming on iOS</a>. If you were ever interested in learning about ReactiveCocoa but didn't know where to start, here you go. </p>

<p>All the source code discussed in the book is <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/FunctionalReactivePixels">open</a> and licensed under the MIT license. </p>

<p>I'd really appreciate anything you could do to help spread the word. Every little bit helps!</p></import>
