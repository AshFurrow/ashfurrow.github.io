<import><p>When I wrote the <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/whiskey-list">whisky app</a> I wrote about last week, I mentioned that <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/922178-Whiskey-List">the icon</a> was took the longest time. In reality, it was the hardest thing for me to do. However, it's a lot better than any of my previous attempts at icon design (or even design in general).</p>

I think I've come a long way. I've been exercising my skills by trying to reproduce real-world objects, like <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/926143-Wine-List-II">this one</a>.</p>
