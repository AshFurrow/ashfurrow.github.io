<import><p>Within a week's span of one another, my work backup drive and my home iMac's SSD drives failed. Completely and without warning. The backup drive isn't a big deal, since all my work is on git or dropbox. However, my home machine was rendered completely useless as I returned home to edit my vacation photos. </p>

<p>Luckily, I use an external drive at home to store my photos and I use Time Machine to keep my main drive (only 120GB) backed up. All my data is safe (*grammar nerds: fuck you). </p>

<p>In addition to all that, my <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/moved-away-from-wordpress">Wordpress install</a> got hacked.</p>

<p>These issues have lead to some questions I began asking myself. The data on these drives matter to me. My blog matters to me. So why am I taking such risks?</p>

<p>As a result of asking these questions, I made some major changes to the way I manage my digital life. I purchased a <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> account to host my blog. I purchased <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af3767">Backblaze</a> to store off-site backups of all of my data. I'm not taking risks with what matters to me. I upgraded my Internet account from the cheapest, most basic package I could pay for.</p>

<p>These changes fit in with what I've been doing this year to take control of my digital life. I'm looking at what matters to me and what I enjoy doing. If something matters, but I don't enjoy it, then I'm happy to pay someone else to do it for me. </p>

<p>I hate managing web servers, but I had to do it to have a Wordpress website. So I got rid of it. </p>

<p>Boom. </p>

<p>As another example, I purchased <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> a few months ago to help me keep my online identity secure. I paid a one-time $50 pricetag, and now I <em>never</em> have to worry about my identity getting stolen online because the Playstation Network got hacked (again). </p>

<p>In some ways, this is a financial burden. I'm paying a little bit of money each month, but the benefit is so worth it. Now I can spend that extra mental effort I was wasting on ways to enrich my life, including earning money. It's a net win. </p>

<p>I'm taking control of my life online because it matters to me and because I'd rather spend time doing what I value than waste time to try and save what amounts to only a few dollars a month.</p></import>
