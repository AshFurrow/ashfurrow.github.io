<p>Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield gave a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_hadfield_what_i_learned_from_going_blind_in_space?awesm=on.ted.com_g075A&amp;utm_content=awesm-bookmarklet&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium=on.ted.com-facebook-share&amp;utm_source=direct-on.ted.com">TED talk</a> on fear. I highly recommend it. </p>

<p>It's interesting because he describes the NASA training astonauts undergo in order to prepare for things going wrong. To paraphrase, they don't just practice when things go right, they practice when things go wrong, too. </p>

<p>It's a great talk – you should check it out. </p>
