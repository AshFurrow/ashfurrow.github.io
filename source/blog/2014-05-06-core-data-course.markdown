<p>I'm really excited to tell you all about my new <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-diary-app-using-core-data">Core Data Course </a> at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. </p>

<p>The course covers the basics of Core Data and includes steps to create a re-usable, general-purpose Core Data stack. It covers what managed objects are and where they live in a typical Core Data stack, and much more. I had a blast recording this course and I hope that you enjoy it. </p>

<p>Check out the trailer video for more. </p>
