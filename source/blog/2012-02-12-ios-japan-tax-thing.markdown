<import><p>For a long time I excluded Japan in my list of countries I sell apps to; it's a simple process in iTunesConnect. I did this because, two years ago, I read something funny about Japan and "extra forms" or something and I decided this was easier. I changed my mind six months ago, which didn't really <em>change</em> anything since none of my apps were in Japanese.<!--more-->
Well that changed in December when I released my <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/2011/12/localization_update/" target="_blank">update</a> to my Solar System Simulator app.</p>
<p>Marco Arment posted a link to a <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/02/01/understanding-japanese-app-store-withholding/" target="_blank">very informative article</a> on how this works and how to stop the Japanese Government from withholding 20% of your app revenue. I checked and, in fact, I had lost over ¥ 800 in December.</p>

<p>It's only about $10 in Canadian Dollars, but it'll add up. And from a principled perspective, I'm being taxed when I oughtn't to.</p></import>
