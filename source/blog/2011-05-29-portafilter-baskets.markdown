<p>When I got married, my wife and I asked our good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/laurenevail" target="_blank">Lauren Vail</a> to say a few words about her friendship with us. She took this opportunity to call me a coffee snob. Well-played.</p>

<p>I was on <a href="http://coffeegeek.com/" target="_blank">CoffeeGeek</a> looking for reviews on different espresso machines to be considered in my <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/index.php/2011/05/new-espresso-machine/">upcoming purchase</a> (a financially dangerous activity) when <a href="http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/markprince/04-29-2011" target="_blank">this article</a> was on the front page.</p>

<p>It describes, essentially, a massive amount of effort that a company has put into new portafilter baskets. These are the baskets within which coffee grinders are placed to have high-pressure water run through them to produce espresso.</p>

<p>The baskets are very important in the brewing process; I've gone to <a href="http://atteroignorantiam.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-portafilter-baskets-have-arrived.html">some lengths</a> to make sure my baskets are up-to-snuff. Most sub-$500 machines today come with portafilter baskets "featuring" crema-enhancers which abide by the North American tradition of charging more for something that doesn't work. Anyways, these new filters have been designed <em>very</em> accurately - using computer models to simulate how water moves from the grouphead, through the grinds, and out of the pores in the filter basket.</p>

<p>They're everything Lauren was talking about when she said "coffee snob"; they're exclusive,Â unnecessary, expensive, and I want them.</p>
