<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.mbaonline.com/cost-of-iphone/">pretty snazzy infographic</a> detailing the complete lifetime of an iPhone, from design to production to use to waste. <!--more--></p>

<p>While I find the invocation of Foxconn workers' suicide rate inflammatory and a bit fallacious (considering it's below China's national average), it's only an infographic, so I'm giving them a pass on not providing all of the context.</p>
