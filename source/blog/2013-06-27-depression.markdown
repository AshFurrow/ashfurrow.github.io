<import><p>Stephen Fry <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/2013/06/24/only-the-lonely/">recently blogged</a> about his struggles with depression. Wil Wheaton has <a href="http://wilwheaton.net/2012/09/depression-lies/">done the same</a>. More and more often, people are beginning to discuss their mental illness openly, ignoring the shame and stigma that society has historically put on the mentally ill. </p>

<p>I'm now 25 and have spent the first half of my twenties suffering from depression. Two major episodes – one late last year and another in university – led me nearly to take my life. My wife saved me by (figuratively) dragging me to help. </p>

<p>I still struggle with my mood, but I'm feeling much better thanks to the help I've received. Through prescribed medication and Buddhist meditation, I'm enjoying my life again. </p>

<p>I wish that I had something more substantial to add to the dialogue than "me too", but sometimes it's worth knowing that you're not alone, and that it can get better. </p>

<p>If you're having thoughts of hurting yourself, please seek help.</p></import>
