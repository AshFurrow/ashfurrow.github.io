<p>I made the switch to double-edged "safety" razors a few months ago. I chose the <a href="http://www.fendrihan.com/weishi-classic-doubleedge-razor-p-174.html" target="_blank">Weshi Classic</a> because it was apparently great for beginners. Bad decision.
"Good for beginners" means "it's a toy." I earnestly think it's impossible to cut your face with this thing, as there is no room between the blade and the guard and the blade is quite recessed. I've moved onto a much friendlier razor and will let you know how that goes. It's only been two shaves but I finally feel the closer shave I was promised with the safety razor.</p>

<p>Aside: For anyone using safety razors, The Shamporium in King's Place as Merkur 10-packs of Super Platinum bales for 95 cents.</p>
