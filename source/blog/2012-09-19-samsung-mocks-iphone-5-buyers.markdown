<p>Great article on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/19/3358132/samsung-mock-iphone-5-commercial">The Verge</a> discussing Samsung's latest Galaxy S3 ad, which mocks Apple users.</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe data-image-dimensions="640x360" allowfullscreen="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nf5-Prx19ZM?fs=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="640" data-embed="true" frameborder="0" height="360" class="embed-responsive-item"></iframe></div>

<p>Classy, guys. </p>

<p>The Verge comments that it's strange to mock potential customers, but I don't think that's what Samsung is aiming for here. </p>

<p>Samsung is looking for centrist consumers who probably might not even have a smart phone yet, and who think that waiting in line overnight for a <em>cell phone</em> is silly. People like my mom. </p>

<p>I'm not sure people won over by such a negative ad are the kind of customers Apple wants, and I don't think they're the kind of customers I want, either.</p>
