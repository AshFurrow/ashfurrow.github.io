<p>My friend Tom published an interesting post this morning about <a href="http://tomcreighton.com/2012/05/cloning-the-ios-ecosystem/">copying the <em>wrong</em> part of idea</a>. The post is based on something stupid someone commented on Hacker News, and I want to expand on that a little bit.</p>

<p>Let's talk about people saying stupid things on Hacker News. <!--more--></p>

<p>This isn't the typical "people say stupid things online" problem because people on Hacker News are genuinely smart; their reasoning skills are top-notch and they're obviously capable of rational thought. What comments on Hacker News lack is <em>empathy</em>.</p>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News suffer from a severe case of collective egocentrism; they are unable (or unwilling) to see things form another's perspective. From their perspective as developers, it makes sense for them to think something should be a certain way. However, when you consider things from another perspective, say, that of a typical user (or, heaven forgive me for using the term, <em>customer</em>), their assertions seem rather childish.</p>

<p>When you say something <em>should</em> be some way because you <em>want</em> something to be that way, you're throwing yourself under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem">Hume's Guillotine</a>. (side note: what a badass term. I couldn't <em>not</em> use it.)</p>

<p>I've removed Hacker News from my Top Sites for the same reason I stopped visiting Slashdot years ago; the comments became so inane and negative that I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm not saying Hacker News needs to change, just that there are implications for this growing trend of this self-congratulatory negativism of their comments.</p>
