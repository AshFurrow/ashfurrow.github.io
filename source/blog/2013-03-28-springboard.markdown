<p>I've launched a new podcast: <a href="http://springboardshow.com">Springboard</a>. It's a show for newcomers to iOS software development.</p>

<p>My inaugural guest is <a href="http://twitter.com/mb">Matthew Bischoff</a>. We had a great conversation about getting started with your first app, some awesome tips and tricks, and how to get featured by the App Store. Definitely <a href="http://springboardshow.com/?format=rss">subscribe</a> and <a href="http://springboardshow.com/episodes/1">give it a listen</a>.</p>
