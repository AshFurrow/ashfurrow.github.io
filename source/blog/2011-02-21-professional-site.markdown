<import><p>A few months ago, my friend <a href="http://blog.nickhoward.ca/">Nick</a> suggested using WordPress for my website, since iWeb wasn't exactly cutting it. I decided not to, since WordPress is blogging software.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/index.php/2011/02/transitioning-from-attero-ingorantiam/">grew impatient</a> with blogger and finally installed WordPress on my personal website last night.  It's awesome! I'm experimenting with the layout, and I'm thinking about using this WordPress installation as my own site, as a replacement for the current <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/CoffeeTimer/Ash_Furrow.html">ashfurrow.com</a>. Any thoughts?</p></import>
