<import><img src="/img/import/blog/functional-reactive-programming-on-ios/52557A47E4BA43BE81BAD1DEFADFF6D3.png" class="img-responsive"><p>I'm writing a <a href="https://leanpub.com/iosfrp">new book about functional reactive programming on iOS</a>, specifically using ReactiveCocoa. It's going to be a shorter one â€“ about a hundred pages. The source code for the book is <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/FunctionalReactivePixels">available on GitHub</a>. </p>

<p>The book is currently <a href="https://leanpub.com/bestsellers">number two</a> on the bestsellers list, and I couldn't be happier. Thank you to everyone who has purchased a copy. It means a lot to me that people believe enough in my work that they're willing to buy a book I haven't even finished yet. </p></import>
