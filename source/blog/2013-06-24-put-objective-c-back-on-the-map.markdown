<import><p>I've partnered with the good folks down at <a href="https://www.cueup.com/">Cue</a> to organize a <a href="https://objectivechackathon.appspot.com">distributed Objective-C hackathon</a> this weekend. </p>

<p>Yes I am. And all of my students will be committing to open source Objective-C. Huzzah!</p></import>
