<import><p>I brought a shitty old Breville milk frothing pitcher into work when Evgeny and Oleg bought the office a Rocky/Silvia combo (awesome!). The milk pitcher doesn't have a spout, is way too large, and everyone's been dissatisfied with it. Last week, I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SCEZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ashfur-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0054SCEZC" target="_blank">Toroid 12oz milk pitcher</a>, and the results have been fantastic.<!--more-->
You can't see it from the pictures online, but the toroid features a very unique shape on the underside that makes it easy to foam milk. No, like properly foam milk, even with a shitty $80 espresso machine. You point the steam wand straight at the bottom of the pitcher and it takes care of the whirlpool action for you; the steam pressure creates a kind of torus shape called a <em>toroidÂ </em>(get it?) and so you just lower and raise the pitcher to create the however much foam you want. Couldn't be easier.</p>

<p>Let me make this simple for you: if you're making milk-based espresso drinks and you're not happy with the results, you just need to go buy this. It's incredible.</p>
<p>Get it on Amazon in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SCEZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ashfur-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0054SCEZC" target="_blank">12oz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDZFEW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ashfur-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005LDZFEW" target="_blank">20oz</a> versions (I'd recommend the 12oz).</p></import>
