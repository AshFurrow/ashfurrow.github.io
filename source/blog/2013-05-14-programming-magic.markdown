title: "Programming Magic"

<import><p>When I was in university, every time I sat down to program I felt a rush of excitement and a sense of exploration. I would always learn something new, and things always felt new to me. </p>

<p>By the time one programming language was beginning to feel old, I would start learning another for a new course or a new project. Eventually I settled on Objective-C and I've spent the past four years refining that knowledge. </p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, programming lost its magic. </p>

<p>I've now become a professional who recognizes a problem and reaches for the exact tool to solve it. There's no room for exploration any more. The most enjoyable parts of programming have become the parts where I get to explore a new API, but most of my work has become routine. </p>

<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">ReactiveCocoa</a>. A <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/reactivecocoa/">whole new paradigm</a> to write programs in. I'd be lying if I said part of my infatuation with ReactiveCocoa wasn't rooted in the fact that it's brought back a sense of wonder and excitement to writing programs. However, ReactiveCocoa feels like magic because it <em>is</em> magic: a collection of clever tricks on top of the Objective-C runtime that gives programmers the freedom to program declaratively. </p>

<p>It's learning curve is steep, but the creators of the project are working on it. Every question I've asked about it has been promptly answered by one of them on StackOverflow. </p>

<p>I would highly encourage you to check it out. I'm working on a series of new blog posts that'll help flatten out that curve. Stay tuned. </p></import>
