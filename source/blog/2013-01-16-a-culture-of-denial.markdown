<p>I read a very insightful article this morning about Aaron Swartz's suicide and the <a href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/01/15/aaron-swartz-a-culture-of-denial-depression-suicide-in-tech/">culture of denial in the tech world</a>. One of the key takeaways from the article is that there still exists a stigma around mental illness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stigma still exists in many parts of our society, and often found among people who don’t think twice about health problems. There are still many — too many — who believe mental illness is a “made up” problem and that people can just help themselves out of the problem if they only put their mind to it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, no one would insist that you can simply <em>will</em> yourself to not have a broken leg. Or not be inflicted with hepatitis. Or whatever other physical ailment you might have. However, mental illness is treated differently. </p>

<p>I've heard people in our industry insist — unsolicitedly — that anyone can simply think away stress or depression or what-have-you with the right kind of attitude. The biggest problem with this reasoning is that it re-inforces the misinformed idea that it is someone's <em>fault</em> for struggling with a mental disorder. </p>

<p>It's not just a culture of denial — it's a culture of blame.</p>
