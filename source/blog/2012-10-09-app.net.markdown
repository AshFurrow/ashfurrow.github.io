<p>So lsat week was pretty huge for <a href="https://alpha.app.net">App.net</a>. Tapbots, makes of the most stylish of iOS apps, released a Tweetbot lookalike named <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/">Netbot</a>. Along with an alpha of an OS X app named <a href="http://wedge.natestedman.com">Wedge</a>, I've found a spot of App.net in my day-to-day routine, as I'm sure many other nerds have.</p>

<p>I took a look at what was going on in my stream, and I decided that these discussions were worth participating in. </p>

<p>App.net is a group of nerds who are taking their conversations seriously. It's ... different from Twitter. Not better, not worse, just different. </p>

<p>What you get out of these services is exactly proportional to what you put into them. Twitter will keep being Twitter; I'm excited to see what happens on App.net. </p>

<p>If only they could just come out and call it "alpha", I'd be a lot happier.</p>
