<p>My side project, <a href="http://35mm.io">35mm</a>, launched today. I'm super stoked about it!</p>

<p>35mm is a Newsstand iPad app designed to showcase amazing photography, curated from around the Internet. There are blogs and sites you can get similar content from, but they're all ad-supported. That's fine, but we saw an opportunity for something different. </p>

<p>If you're interested in hearing more about how we built 35mm, check out a <a href="http://springboardshow.com/episodes/2013/10/6/35mm-with-tom-creighton">special episode of Springboard</a>.</p>

<p>If you could <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/35mm/id659514572?mt=8">download it</a> and leave a review, I would be super-grateful. It comes with a free seven-day trial, too!</p>
