<import><p>I got an (unsolicited) email from <a href="http://www.chupamobile.com/products/details/277/Get+more+AppStore+ratings+with+recurring+UIAlert/" target="_blank">Chupa</a> this morning asking to participate in their competition to win ten grand. Doesn't sound like a scam at all does it? Boy was I surprised...<!--more-->
Basically, you write different libraries and sell them on their site. I assume they get a cut somehow. Not a <em>bad</em>Â idea, but kind of a crooked one when you look at what's available. After 30 seconds of browsing the iOS library, I found <a href="http://www.chupamobile.com/products/details/277/Get+more+AppStore+ratings+with+recurring+UIAlert/" target="_blank">this gem</a>:</p>

I'd rather get the original, open-source <a href="https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater" target="_blank">Appirater</a>:</p>

The only resources a mobile developer needs are StackOverflow and GitHub. I think Chupa is trying to appeal to people who are new at iOS development (or Ruby or whatever) and want quick-fixes.</p>
<p>Judging from the presentation of their libraries, I have almost no confidence in the quality of the code they sell or the maintenance the code will get. I won't be using Chupa and I suggest if you have a really cool library, you put it up on GitHub where you'll get Internet famous. It'll be worth more.</p></import>
