<p>I read an <a href="http://www.devjoy.com/2013/02/why-do-cars-have-brakes/">interesting article</a> this morning comparing brakes on cars to unit tests for software development. </p>

<p>The metaphor is that brakes allow you to drive faster by letting you stop where you want. Unit tests allow you develop faster by letting you stop where you want â€“ when something is broken.</p>

<p>The next time you start a new project, <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/unit-testing-objective-c-using-kiwi">think about it</a>.</p>
