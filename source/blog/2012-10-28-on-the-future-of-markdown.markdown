title: "On The Future of Markdown"

<p>I love Markdown. I write this blog in it and I use it all over the web, especially on GitHub and Stack Overflow. </p>

<p>This is why I was really excited to see Jeff Atwood propose a new plan for a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html">Markdown specification</a>. Currently, Markdown is defined by John Gruber's original implementation. Unsurprisingly, people around the internet have developed their own "flavours" of Markdown to suit their own, specific needs.</p>

<p>Jeff Atwood wants to unify these flavours under one name with one spec and a test suite for writing your own Markdown interpreter. And he's seeking the blessing of Markdown's creator, John Gruber.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, John Gruber has been less than receptive towards the plan.</p>

<p>What I find interesting about all this is that, until now, I didn't really have a problem with Gruber having complete control over Markdown. I mean, it'd be unlikely that he would make a change that would adversely effect my ability to access (and write) things like this blog, right? </p>

<p>It's now apparent that Gruber is willing to get Markdown stagnate as the Internet moves on.</p>

<p>Sadface. </p>

<p>Famously, or perhaps infamously, John Siracusa has <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/33">eschewed Markdown</a> in favour of HTML for this exact reason: since there is a spec for hTML, he is assured that his writing will always be accessible and access to it is not beholden to the markup syntax <em>du jour</em>.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm abandoning Markdown, but I definitely have doubts about its future (or more to the point, it's lack of a one). I'm very excited about Jeff Atwood's project and I hope that the rest of the Internet isn't content to let Markdown remain Gruber's personal fiefdom. </p>
