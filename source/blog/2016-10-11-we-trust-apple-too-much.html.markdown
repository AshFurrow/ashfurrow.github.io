_A blog post in five tweets._

So we all know about Dash know, eh? [Apple acted rashly against an indie dev](https://blog.kapeli.com/apple-removed-dash-from-the-app-store), [the developer called them on it](https://blog.kapeli.com/dash-and-apple-my-side-of-the-story), and the iOS developer community failed to rally behind the developer like it should have.

I wrote these tweets as I waddled through security in New York, _before_ the Kapeli told their side of the story. I think we need more of this critical thinking towards Apple. Something I've said before:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you love Apple, think critically about their decisions. Question their motives and decisions. Embrace nuance, reject extremism.</p>&mdash; Ash vs NSThread (@ashfurrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/773856902304366592">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Matt Drance really summed the whole Dash situation up it up well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Again, it doesn&#39;t entirely matter if he ends up a liar. The levee broke too early. The end.</p>&mdash; Matt Drance (@drance) <a href="https://twitter.com/drance/status/785635370939523072">October 11, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Apple is [just a company](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/crestfallen/). I know we all like them, and we want them to do well, but sometimes Apple will fail to live up to our ideals and our expectations. We've got to be ready to hold them accountable.
