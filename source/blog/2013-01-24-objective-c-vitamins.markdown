<import><p>This week, I gave a talk at <a href="http://techtalksto.com/post/40607791416/ash-furrow-presenting-accessibility-and-unit-testing">Tech Talks TO</a> discussing the "vitamins" that the Objective-C community needs to grow up to be big and strong. Er, I mean to become a stable and mature platform.</p>

I also say that UI Acceptance Testing is not really feasible, which is hyperbolic. The tools are coming a long way, in no small part thanks to my friend <a href="https://github.com/tapi">Paddy</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/moredip/Frank">Frank</a>.</p></import>
