<p>I read an article this morning detailing the complete <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support" target="_blank">failure of Google and handset OEMs to provide existing smartphone users (er, customers?) with OS updates</a>.
The biggest problem here, from my perspective, is added constraints on developers. Developers at the <a href="http://androidto.com/" target="_blank">AndroidTO conference</a> were talking about building for a particular Android version because it "only" excluded 20% of users. iOS developers typically wait until they're excluding <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/08/13/instapaper-ios-device-and-version-stats-update" target="_blank">1% or users, or fewer</a>.</p>

<p>Android OEMs and Google need to step up if they expect developers to write apps on their platform.</p>
