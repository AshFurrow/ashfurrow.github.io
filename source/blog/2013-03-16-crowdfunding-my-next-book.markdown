<import><p>I've decided to crowdfund my next book on <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/your-first-ios-app/x/2700170">Indigogo</a> and I'm super pumped!</p>

<p>It's going to be an in-depth, ground-up book on writing your first iOS app. I've had this book on my mind since last September and I'm finally ready to begin work. </p>

<p>Sample code is going to be available on GitHub. Backers at the "Assistant Editor" level are going to get early access to the code and chapters via GitHub. </p>
