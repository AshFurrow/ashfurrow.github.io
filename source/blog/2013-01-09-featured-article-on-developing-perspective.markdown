<import><p>David Smith featured the <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/seven-deadly-sins-of-modern-objective-c">article I wrote</a>, as well as <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/12/31/coders_in_the_hands_of_an_angry_god">Brent Simmons'</a> follow up posts, yesterday on <a href="http://developingperspective.com/2013/01/08/103/">his podcast</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://developingperspective.com">Developing Perspective</a> is a great, daily podcast David Smith does about development topics. It's never longer than 15 minutes and fits right into my daily commute. If you're an Objective-C developer or hobbyist, you really should be listening to it.</p></import>
