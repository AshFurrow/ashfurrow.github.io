<import><p>I wrote a while ago about <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/2012/05/stop-saying-no-to-your-designer">saying no to designers</a> and how I had learned not to do it anymore. I pointed out that well-designed apps just don't happen – they take the hard work and collaboration of designers and developers to realize something great. </p>

<p>Evan Doll <a href="https://twitter.com/edog1203/status/309275190410485760">tweeted</a> this morning a quote from Craig Hockenberry that really struck me:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>"Designers aren't burdened with implementation details. In other words, they're just like our customers." - @<a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry">chockenberry</a></p>— Evan Doll (@edog1203) <a href="https://twitter.com/edog1203/status/309275190410485760">March 6, 2013</a>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>You would not say "no" to a customer or client – you'd let them know that their request would take extra time (and, therefore, maybe extra money). You'd let them make an informed decision.</p>

<p>Let you designers lead the design of your application – the implementation details are your problem and no one else's.</p></import>
