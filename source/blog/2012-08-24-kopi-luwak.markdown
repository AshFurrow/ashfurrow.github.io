It is the world's most expensive coffee, since it has been through the digestive tract of a type of Indonesian cat called a luwak, or civet. </p>

<p>Of course I was already interested. When our boss saw the email, he actually bought a pound of the coffee for the 500px office, which I had the honour of roasting at home and bringing in to serve to my coworkers. </p>

<p>Roasting the coffee was very interesting: it didn't have the usual repugnant smell of unroasted coffee, but wasn't as aromatic in the days that followed. </p>

<p>The coffee is pretty fantastic - very smooth. It has a buttery mouth feel and I'm really happy to have had tried it, though it's far too expensive to consume on a regular basis!</p>

<p>If you're a coffee nerd, I would highly recommend giving it a shot at some point. It's completely safe - the beans are thoroughly cleaned and dried before being roasted at over 400 degrees.</p>

<p>Buy the coffee on Amazon:</p>
