<import><p>I had some time off between jobs recently, and I really like Scotch, so I decided to spend some time throwing together an app to help me keep track of tasting notes of all the whiskies I like. I treated it partially as a challenge to use <code>UICollectionView</code>, on which I'm writing a short book, and also to see how quickly I can develop it.</p>

<p>The total development time on this project is 18 hours, about a third of which I spent actually drinking whiskey. I also used collection views â€“ in fact, I found a way to abuse them that I'm sure is unique. </p>

<p>The hardest and lengthiest component was the <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/922178-Whiskey-List?list=following">icon</a>, on which I had tremendous help from Eric Akaoka and Zev Eisenberg. </p>

<p>If you're a whiskey drinker, please <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whiskey-list/id595526608">go buy my app</a> and then give it a rating. Any rating, even a mediocre one, will help me.</p>

<p>I'm not expecting to get rich off of this, and it will probably be my last personal app for a while, but it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the challenge. </p></import>
