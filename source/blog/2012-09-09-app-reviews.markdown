<p>I was pretty happy to wake up this morning to a positive review on my app, 
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-hour/id524263013">Photo Hour</a>. Despite my efforts designing a simple, clean app, it hasn't enjoyed many downloads. I have had two "free" sales where I give away copies of my app to garner app reviews where about three thousand copies of my app was downloaded. This is the first review since those sales.</p>

<p>App reviews, even bad ones, are <em>incredibly</em> valuable to app developers because they affect search result ranking in the App Store. </p>

<p>I looked at my downloads numbers, and I've actually started selling more copies of it lately. Awesome! </p>

<p>Here's a deal: you rate my app, and if you're ever downtown Toronto, I'll take you out for a coffee :) </p>
