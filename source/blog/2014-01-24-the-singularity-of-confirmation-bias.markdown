<p>"The Singularity" – that supposed future event when computers achieve sentience – came up at lunch the other day, and I rolled me eyes. Ray Kurzweil's ideas about the future of machines and society are, in my opinion, far-fetched, but he has some believers. The thing is he's so often correct in his predictions. </p>

<p>Or is he? </p>

<p>Confirmation bias is the tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses, according to Wikipedia. People tend to ignore facts that don't back up their beliefs. </p>

<p>Let me quote again from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel Lyons, writing in Newsweek, criticized Kurzweil for some of his predictions that turned out to be wrong, such as the economy continuing to boom from the 1998 dot-com through 2009, a US company having a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, a supercomputer achieving 20 petaflops, speech recognition being in widespread use and cars that would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways; all by 2009.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>... and none of that happened. <em>Turns out</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the charge that a 20 petaflop supercomputer was not produced in the time he predicted, Kurzweil responded that he considers Google a giant supercomputer, and that it is indeed capable of 20 petaflops.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The thing with "theorists" like Kurzweil is that no data can ever prove them wrong, in their eyes. It's so frustrating to evidence-based practioners like myself. </p>
