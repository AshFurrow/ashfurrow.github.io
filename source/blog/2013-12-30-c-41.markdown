<p>My latest app, C-41, is <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/C-41">available</a> as an open source project on GitHub. I'll be submitting it to Apple for approval this week. </p>

<p>I wrote this app as a learning experience. I've learnt a lot about ReactiveCocoa and Model-View-ViewModel in the past few months, but I wanted to apply it to a real-world app that used Core Data, and also has a comprehensive suite of unit tests (still working on that bit). </p>

<p>Take a look. If you have suggestions, open an issue or fork the repo. I learnt a lot from writing C-41 and I hope that other can learn from it, too. </p>
