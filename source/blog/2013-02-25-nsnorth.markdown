<import><p>Just a reminder that I'll be attending <a href="http://nsnorth.ca">NSNorth</a> in April. </p>

<p>The topics are more high-level than nitty-gritty, but that's good. Every conference can't be a WWDC-inspired technical tour. </p>

<p>There's a good speaker line-up, including my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbrennan">Jason</a>. </p>

<p>Definitely worth the trip to Ottawa if you're available. </p></import>
