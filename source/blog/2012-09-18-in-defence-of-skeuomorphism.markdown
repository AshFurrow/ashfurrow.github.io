<p>Eric Portelance <a href="https://twitter.com/eportelance/status/248069041254715393">tweeted this morning</a> a fascinating interview with a former Apple designer who <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670796/a-former-iphone-ui-designer-defends-apples-fake-leather-design-philosophy">defends Apple's recent uses of skeuomorphism</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A leather texture, for example, definitely creates a certain environment and state of mind when you’re using it. I don’t think there is right and wrong, or good and bad here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Like anything in design, there is <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/skeu-it">tasteful use of skeuomorphism</a> and then there is <a href="http://skeu.it">going too far</a>. Too much of anything can be bad.</p>

<p>Apple has arguably optimized for the first-time user experience of their apps, but their use of skeuomorphism has a purpose. I think many nerds who are upset about skeuomorphism aren't taking that purpose into account.  </p>
