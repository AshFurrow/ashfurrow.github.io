<import><p>I'm very happy to announce that I've been added to the <a href="http://fusionads.net">Fusion Ad Network</a>'s list of publishers. This network includes some of my favourite tech writers, including <a href="http://512pixels.net">Stephen Hackett</a>, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell</a>, and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of my blog has always been, first and foremost, to write about things I am passionate about. I've been refining my professional and writing skills to work towards the goal of becoming authoritative on Objective-C and iOS development. I still have a <em>long</em> way to go, and this blog will document the whole journey.</p>

<p>Making money has never been the goal for me - elevating my writing to the point where it is serious enough to advertise against has been. I'm really looking forward to what's in store.</p></import>
