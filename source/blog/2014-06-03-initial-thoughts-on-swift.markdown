<import><p>Yesterday, Apple announced a brand new programming language as a replacement for Objective-C called Swift. </p>
<img src="/img/import/blog/initial-thoughts-on-swift/256261AB37274AD2862C86F6D0F196E4.png" class="img-responsive"><p>Super cool. I <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/we-need-to-replace-objective-c">wrote</a> about replacing Objective-C a few months ago, and I'm glad to see this update from Apple. Here was my list of criteria for a "good" replacement:</p>
<ol>
<li>It shouldn't use pointers, structs, header files, anything C-based</li>
<li>It should be a memory-managed language (No ARC, not retain/release, no Core Foundation)</li>
<li>It should have native, unicode strings and native collections</li>
<li>It should be concise</li>
<li>It should have named parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>It looks like everything except memory-management has been checked off, and I haven't played around with it enough to determine if it's new memory management system is up to snuff, but from what I've seen so far, I am very impressed with Swift. </p>
<p>I'm very impressed with Apple's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11">book</a> on Swift. It's great that this stuff isn't sealed under NDA. </p>
<p>I'm planning on writing at least one book on Swift, which will be out in the coming months. While I'm impressed with the resources Apple has released, I think that there is room for some third-party resources, too. </p></import>
