<import><p><a href="http://storygram.me/" target="_blank">storygram</a>, the app a coworker and I made during a <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/2011/12/storygram/">drunken weekend hackathon</a>, was <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/01/06/instagram-meets-500px-with-the-new-ios-app-storygram/" target="_blank">featured on The Next Web</a> recently. The article mentions a few bugs and features they'd like to see, and I've been in correspondance with users on twitter. Needless to say, the updates are already in the works :)</p>
