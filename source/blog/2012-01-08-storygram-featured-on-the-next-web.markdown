[storygram](http://storygram.me/), the app a coworker and I made during a [drunken weekend hackathon](https://ashfurrow.com/2011/12/storygram/), was [featured on The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/01/06/instagram-meets-500px-with-the-new-ios-app-storygram/) recently. The article mentions a few bugs and features they'd like to see, and I've been in correspondance with users on twitter. Needless to say, the updates are already in the works :)

Sadly, I haven't seen a 20000% increase in sales for my paid apps. Yet.
