<import><p>A few months ago, I <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/blog/new-job-1">started a new job</a> at <a href="https://artsy.net">Artsy</a>. Artsy is based in New York and I've been working remotely from Amsterdam. </p>

<p>We took advantage of me being in America for WWDC to have me come to New York for a week and work in-house. It's only Tuesday but it's already been a great experience.</p>

<p>The Artsy team is incredible â€“ everyone is very good at what they do. I've been making connections with coworkers that I didn't even know I had (the team is actually pretty large). </p>

<p>After quitting my old job in Amsterdam, I had had some self-doubt about whether or not I made the right decision. Not working for a Dutch company, I'd only get to stay a year in Amsterdam. After meeting the Artsy team in-person, I'm now 100% confident that I made the right decision. </p></import>
