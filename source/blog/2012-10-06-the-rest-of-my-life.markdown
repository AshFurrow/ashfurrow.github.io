<p><a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html">This article</a> made the rounds this week. It asks the question: "do you want to be programming when you're 50?"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was still a professional programmer, my office-mate once asked out of the blue, "Do you really want to be doing this kind of work when you're fifty?" </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Absolutely, positively, unequivocally <em>yes</em>. </p>

<p>Let's stop a think for a second. </p>

<p><em>What do I do</em>?</p>

<p>I solve interesting problems in creative ways. </p>

<p>If that's not your definition for programming, then you're doing it wrong. If that's not what you want do <em>for the rest of your life</em>, then you must be an incredibly boring person. </p>

<p>We are makers; we take abstract ideas that exist <em>only inside our imaginations</em> and turn them into concrete, working software. We <em>make</em> things. We are in the same field as painters, writers, and musicians. I hazzard that there aren't many poets out there who don't see themselves writing poetry forever. </p>
