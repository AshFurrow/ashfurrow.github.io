<import><p>In case you haven't already seen it, <a href="http://skeu.it">Skeu It!</a> is a delightful new Tumblr dedicated to showcasing skeumorphism gone wrong. Readers submit screenshots of apps and the author provides some pretty funny feedback.</p>

<p>Today, he released an <a href="http://skeu.it/post/31463162523/faq">FAQ</a>, which, in part, read as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You should be providing meaningful critique</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Just yesterday, two indie devs submitted their own work with their own captions. Humility is a beneficial trait. As someone who routinely presents work that doesnâ€™t get the response I had hoped, I can assure you laughing about it is pretty fun.</p>

<img src="/img/import/blog/skeu-it/1CDD0F5D25B3492A876BF7172C4FAE82.jpg" class="img-responsive"><p>I was actually one of those indie devs; I submitted <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/photo-hour/id524263013?mt=8">Photo Hour</a>, an app I wrote to tell you the best time of the day to take photos. I made it look and feel like an SLR camera, and I wasn't expecting to get serious feedback.</p>

<p>Just Maxwell responded with some great feedback that I'm looking forward to incorporating into a future release. He said that my use of skeuomorphism was appropriate for my audience, and I think that is the real issue with all these nerds who are hating on skeu.</p>

<p>Skeuomorphism isn't <em>inherently bad</em>, but it has a place. Skeu It! is a reminder of how slapping linen on everything isn't good design, but linen in a design isn't necessarily bad design, either.</p></import>
