<p>I've started a new, weekly podcast called <a href="http://www.notificationcenter.tv">Notification Center</a>. It's a talk-show discussing iOS news and events with my co-host, <a href="http://twitter.com/swizzlr">Tom</a>. Check it out, give it a listen, and let me know what you think. </p>

<p>Our first week discusses a lot of open source stuff that happened, like the CocoaPods repo fix and OmniGraphSketcher being open sourced. </p>

<p>I'm also particularly proud of the site, since we threw it together ourselves. Typically I'd go with Squarespace for something like this, but it was a lot of fun to flex my (albeit limited) web dev muscles. </p>

<p>It'll be on iTunes soon; or you can use the <a href="http://www.notificationcenter.tv/feed.rss">RSS feed</a> for now. </p>
