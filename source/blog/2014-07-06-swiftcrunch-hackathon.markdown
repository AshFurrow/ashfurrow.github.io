<import><p>After WWDC, once Swift had been announced, I was contacted by some developers in Poland who wanted to organize the first ever Swift hackathon. Really neat idea – and they wondered if I was interested in giving the keynote. </p>

<p>I accepted and am just finishing up the <a href="http://swiftcrunch.com">SwiftCrunch</a> hackathon now. It's been a fantastic experience – I've met a lot of great developers and had a great time. </p>
<p>Here are my slides from the keynote. They don't give a <em>tonne</em> of context, but it was recorded so I'll post the video later once it's up. </p>

One of the most interesting projects is <a href="https://github.com/ksm/SwiftInFlux">SwiftInFlux</a>, a community-based project for cataloguing the changes that Apple is probably going to make to Swift before 1.0 ships. </p>
<p>My project reproduces <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/slingshot/id878681557?mt=8">Facebook Slingshot</a>'s UI for presenting notifications, and it's available <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/ModalNotificationController">on GitHub</a>. </p>
