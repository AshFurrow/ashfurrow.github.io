<p>God I hate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/sep/20/apple-google-maps-headache">tabloid reporting</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google, I hear from roundabout sources, is enjoying the bad press Apple is suffering.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Google isn't a person! It's not <em>enjoying</em> anything! </p>

<p>A "well placed source" could be anyone. Who knows if they know what the fuck is going on. </p>

<p>Facts are that we don't know who severed the Google Maps integration in iOS 6 or for what reason. </p>

<p>Companies aren't people; they don't experience joy, schadenfreude, or orgasmic pleasure at their rivals' discomfort. Stop personifying corporations. </p>
