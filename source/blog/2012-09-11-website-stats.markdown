<p>(I'll try not to get too meta, here.)</p>

<p>In case you haven't noticed, I'm taking this blog a lot more seriously lately. I'm writing more frequently and with more focused, developer-oriented articles. I thought I'd compare July and August to the same time frame in 2011, before I started at 500px.</p>

<p>This isn't the astronomical increase it appears to be, since Google analytics doesn't treat the horizontal axis as zero.</p>

<p>Still! It's nice to know on my worst day <em>now</em>, I'm getting more viewers than on my best day of the previous year. Onwards and upwards!</p>

<p>If you ever have suggestions for improvements or articles you'd like me to write, please <a href="http://ashfurrow.com/about/">get in touch</a>.</p>
