I've bene overwhelemed by the response from the Internet. Thanks to everyone who's gotten in touch.</p>

<p>The show is a success in the one dimension that I care about: it's being listened to. The show's site receives over three hundred visitors a day. In contrast, it took years of blogging before my own site ever approached that figure. </p>

<p>I've recorded a number of episodes now, and it's been remarkable to meet with really interesting people and get them to share their stories with listeners. Absolutely fantastic. </p>

<p>If you've enjoyed the show, please consider <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/springboard/id627783621?mt=2">rating it on iTunes</a>, which would help new listeners find it. </p>

<p>I'm really excited about where this is going. </p></import>
