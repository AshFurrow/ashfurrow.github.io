<import><p>I'm very excited about <a href="http://the-magazine.org">The Magainze</a>. I enjoy reading the types of articles it features, and in fact, I want to write one myself.</p>

<p>More than just that, though, I just love the fact that this exists. Paying writers is something I want to support. $2/month is very nearly no money to me, and if for no other reason than simply to encourage this type of thing to exist, I'll subscribe.</p></import>
