<p>Ashley and I are still getting used to a lot, including being secluded from our friends and Family out East and the demands of my new job. One thing we're quickly getting used to is the accessibility of almost anything we could possibly want.</p>

<p>Down the street is the <a href="http://www.greenbeanery.ca/bean/" target="_blank">Green Beanery</a> from where I get my coffee.</p>

<p>Further is an award-winning sushi place that we're quickly becoming fans of.</p>

<p>Just beyond there is a clothing store that sells the most amazing selection of bow ties and made-to-measure clothing (if it tickled me).</p>

<p>All within a 10 minute walk of home. We can get your sushi on, buy a new belt, and grab a vegan cupcake with an Italian soda on your way home. Oh, wait, that's actually what we did tonight.</p>

<p>We love it here.</p>
