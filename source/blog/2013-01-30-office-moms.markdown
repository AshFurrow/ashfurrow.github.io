<p>Lauren Bacon has a <a href="http://qz.com/47154/tech-companies-stop-hiring-women-to-be-the-office-mom/">great article</a> discussing offices hiring women to be an "office mom."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He just didn’t have the awareness to appreciate that a) women don’t want to have all the emotional needs of a workplace delegated to them; b) emotional rapport cannot be the sole responsibility of one person (or gender); c) I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this woman didn’t have “coordinate everyone’s lunches and facilitate office conversations” in her job description; and d) I feel pretty confident she was not given significant financial compensation for those aspects of her work (even though it sounds like those skills were rare gems indeed amongst her coworkers).</p>

<p>She has a great list of questions to ask yourself to see how your workplace stacks up against this subtle form of sexism. A really good read. </p>
