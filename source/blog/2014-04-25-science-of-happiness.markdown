<import><p>This morning I watched a very interested <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy">TED Talk on happiness</a>, which is obviously very relative to me given yesterday's blog post. </p>

<p>In the Talk, Dan Gilbert discusses the idea of <em>synthetic happiness</em>, the concept that we can manufacture our own happiness, even if we don't get what we want. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same qualty as what we might call natural happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really struck out to me. It reminds me of another TED talk discussing the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice">paradox of choice</a>, the phenomenon where people with <em>more</em> choices are <em>less</em> happy because they're worried that they won't make the correct choice. </p>

<p>We are apparently really bad at predicting our own happiness due to something called impact bias: we overstate the impact that getting what we want will have on us. Instead of striving to always get what we want, focusing on our mental states of mind will have a far deeper, longer-lasting effect on our happiness. Cool. </p></import>
