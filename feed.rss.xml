      <title>Contemporaneous Blogging</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/contemporaneous-blogging/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; – and &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/"&gt;spoken&lt;/a&gt; – about how we should all be blogging as we learn things. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for many reasons, some selfish and some altruistic. But I&amp;rsquo;ve always said: you really should try and write &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn something. It&amp;rsquo;s when you&amp;rsquo;re best able to describe and bridge the gap between ignorance and understanding. &lt;em&gt;As&lt;/em&gt; you experience the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are other reasons to blog &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn something – contemporaneously with the learning process. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to write about a topic when it&amp;rsquo;s fresh in your mind. Also, even if you &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; to write about something later, it can easily become an item on a todo list that you&amp;rsquo;re likely to put off and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/issues/188#issuecomment-315918906"&gt;not get to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But another reason to blog contemporaneously is that you may just not be able to write about something in the future. A friend recently was laid off and now a blog post they had written contemporaneously – but not published – is out of context and needs to be changed. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re able to fit writing into your schedule – please try to. You never know when life circumstances – job, family, housing – could change. Writing about things &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn them is the best way to capture that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you keep it private, writing is a wonderful way to document knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I encourage you to try it out, even if writing hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a strength for you. I have faith you&amp;rsquo;ll produce something of value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Left Media and Performative Podcasting</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/left-media-and-performative-podcasting/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s the podcast, right? It&amp;rsquo;s by a bunch of hard left folks and they discuss really interesting topics like labour organizing, they provide radical feminist criticisms of popular culture, and they have interesting guests on to discuss their own interesting work. I really enjoy listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: they&amp;rsquo;re a bit problematic. They don&amp;rsquo;t adhere to the usual political correctness typical of the left. The language they use – calling people &amp;ldquo;retarded&amp;rdquo; for example – makes me uncomfortable. They walk a fine line between critique of sexism and sexist critique. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &lt;a href="https://thetrap.fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;when the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CHAPOTRAPHOUSE"&gt;@CHAPOTRAPHOUSE&lt;/a&gt; drops &lt;a href="https://t.co/o1yB9XAUSo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/o1yB9XAUSo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🌴 illy bocean™ 🌴 (@IllyBocean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IllyBocean/status/851320439896850432"&gt;April 10, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the show gains popularity as a tentpole of radical left culture, it&amp;rsquo;s come under increasing scrutiny (largely from liberals). And while I agree with some of the criticisms lobbed at the show, hating it has become a sort of signifier among liberals that &lt;em&gt;yes, I too think Chapo is problematic&lt;/em&gt;. The liberals that somehow managed to lose to Donald Trump(!) think it in vogue to hate &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; and its fans, and to consider the show to be the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; enemy of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Instead of organizing against Trump or his awful policies, they criticize a left-wing podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our capitalist society is so completely imbued with the ideology that &lt;em&gt;you are what you consume&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hesitant to even admit that I listen to the show (lest I get called out as &lt;em&gt;problematic&lt;/em&gt;). But I am not the podcasts I listen to, and I can enjoy media while being critical of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as the hosts of &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; themselves point out: the show is not politics, it is entertainment. Listening to &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; is about as effective at fighting fascism as watching Stephen Colbert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m clearly not saying you can&amp;rsquo;t criticize Chapo. I pretty strongly disagree with a lot of the language they use.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald (@Boringstein) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boringstein/status/885845764655763456"&gt;July 14, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacLean&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; had what is probably the most &lt;a href="http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-rise-of-the-internets-dirtbag-left/"&gt;level-headed analysis of the show&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s emerging popularity. It kind of examines the origins of the show in a roundabout but thoughtful way, interviewing show guest and author Angela Nagle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in dipping your toes in, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check out this episode that discusses a popular concept among the left: universal basic income.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/332459247&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But just listening to a podcast doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help anything. And I want to help. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading books they mention, researching the topics they discuss, and have started getting involved in real-world organization in the socialist left. This action, too, comes from the show. From the &lt;em&gt;MacLean&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chapo’s Frost sees it, the end goal of Left Twitter and catalyzing podcasts like hers is to help the left regain its footing, to organize—and ultimately unplug. &amp;ldquo;The most important thing social media can do politically has always been to get people off the internet,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;People need to get offline and plug into organizing and campaigns in the real world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The past few months of listening to the show, and the resulting challenges to my existing ideologies, have been tectonic shifts for my politics and even my sense of self (and I was already fairly left-leaning before). I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure where I&amp;rsquo;m going, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit scared. That&amp;rsquo;s okay – change is always scary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastodon Interview</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-interview/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;: still a thing. And &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;my instance&lt;/a&gt;, also still a thing! Recently, one of the users on mastodon.technology sat down and &lt;a href="http://www.smays.com/2017/06/ash-furrow/"&gt;interviewed me&lt;/a&gt; about the platform and the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/x3FEs8sgXjE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My participation in Mastodon hasn&amp;rsquo;t been steady, but neither was my participation in Twitter at first. I&amp;rsquo;m still finding my feet and my voice there. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what the future holds; this is still an experiment, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where we end up together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why My Eyes Gently Roll</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/why-my-eyes-gently-roll/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, an article from the Washington Post titled &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/lifestyle/the-slow-secret-death-of-the-electric-guitar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why my guitar gently weeps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; made its way around the internet&amp;rsquo;s various music circles. The article makes some noise about falling guitar sales and draws conclusions from interviews that the author conducted with various captains of industry; its thesis is that sales are trending down, the industry is shrinking, and a lack of &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; is to blame. Young people – apparently – just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough rock stars to look up to and emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to read the post (it&amp;rsquo;s not long) prepare yourself for some extreme eye-rolling. Also, the article uses some weird JavaScript scroll hijacking, so have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as an aside, the article mentions a shift towards more women and girls learning guitar, but brushes their increased interest aside as trivial – or based purely in aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Mooney, the Fender CEO, calls [Taylor] Swift “the most influential guitarist of recent years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that young girls looked at Taylor and said, ‘I’m really impressed by the way she plays G major arpeggios.’ ” Mooney says. “They liked how she looked, and they wanted to emulate her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds dismissive. After all, young folks of the past were focused &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the sounds of musicians and not their looks (for example, this is why KISS is known for wearing only dull boring outfits during performances). Girls don&amp;rsquo;t care about music, just about looks. Uh huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a writing perspective, the biggest weakness of the article is that the author neglected to include perspectives from actual &lt;em&gt;guitarists&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, Geoff Edgars tacitly implies that falling guitar sales = declining industry = declining guitar popularity. A lot of folks around guitar forums and YouTube have pointed out this fallacy, and they further refute the claim that there are no &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; by offering their own list of popular players. Usually men. Actually, all men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that just maybe our society has some kind of problem with attitudes towards women.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with the musicians&amp;rsquo; rebuttal, that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; (gosh I dislike that term). I can name a few bands that really influenced my decision to pick up the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there&amp;rsquo;s such an abundance of educational resources on learning guitar that, since starting in December, I&amp;rsquo;ve at times felt overwhelmed by just how much there is to learn, and just how many ways there are to learn it all. I would be interested in reading an article discussing these resources, the rising popularity of YouTube as a music education platform, and hearing from a variety of musicians (of all genders) about their perspectives on the guitar industry&amp;rsquo;s decline. But that would require the Washington Post to investigate – which is apparently too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feelings are Hard</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/feelings-are-hard/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things have been getting to me lately. Big things, little things, all kinds of things. The result is: I get upset. Angry even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaand because I insist on spending so much of my life on Twitter (I need to stop that&amp;hellip;) everyone gets to see me get upset at things. The latest problems in my life are bringing the wrong computer cable and the LEGO store being sold out of something I want. Pretty childish stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Ash, sounds like you’re not having the best day. Here’s a box of fucking adorable goddamn kittens. It’ll help you on your way. &lt;a href="https://t.co/92nzKdfbFB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/92nzKdfbFB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Aaron Vegh 📎 (@aaronvegh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aaronvegh/status/875051392515403784"&gt;June 14, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, things were going great until about six weeks ago when my doctor suggested going off one of my medications. I&amp;rsquo;m on a very small dose, and we wanted to see if I needed it. Turns out I desperately do. Within a week I was miserable, flat, depressed. I finally got back on the medication, and as soon as it kicked in, I caught a cold. So I&amp;rsquo;m back to feeling miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing guitar can help, except my wrists hurt too much to play. So I get a little more sad. Sleeping helps, I feel better in the mornings. Doing things helps, so I feel better when I make it to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the sort of back drop for this emotional rollercoaster is the political landscape of 2017. What a shitty year it&amp;rsquo;s been and promises to continue to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be okay – I have a supportive partner, and a therapist, and a psychiatrist. And I&amp;rsquo;m making progress all the time. I&amp;rsquo;ve just had such a hard time over the past month or so. This summer was supposed to be refreshing and exciting, but instead it&amp;rsquo;s began with familiar ennui. Things are looking up, I guess, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help feel like I&amp;rsquo;m going to be stuck here forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hitting a Guitar Stride</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/hitting-a-guitar-stride/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months since I bought an acoustic Guitar and &lt;a href="/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;started teaching myself&lt;/a&gt; using the Internet. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an electric guitar too, found an instructor, taken a few lessons, and started recording myself to track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music has been challenging, rewarding, and fun! The last few months in America have sucked, and music has for sure helped me get through some challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be worth looking back on how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come, because I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve recently hit a stride in learning new skills on the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, learning songs was really hard because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to learning the new chords, the rhythm, the lyrics, everything. But as I repeated the learning process over and over, I got better at it. A few weeks ago, I started learning one of my favourite songs and it went a lot easier than other, less challenging songs had gone. Within a week I had gotten to the point I was really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323809759&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learning has gotten easier because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it more, but there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than just that. I feel like each additional skill I learn can be combined with every skill I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned; so there&amp;rsquo;s a combinatorial explosion of ability. A sort of &lt;code&gt;n!&lt;/code&gt; effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about all this was this video below. It&amp;rsquo;s a tutorial from a show I watch that teaches a song; it has a tonne of chords, most of which are new to me, and I would&amp;rsquo;ve been really intimidating to learn even a month ago. Instead, when I found it last weekend I was really excited to learn all the new skills because it means I can connect each one to each other one I already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/LbKPWRxtok0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song has helped me get better at barre chords, descending baseline notes over chords, barre chord slides, muting, strumming speed, all kinds of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly challenging song, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a tonne of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting better and better at guitar (and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it more and more), my wrist pain this week has been really bad. It&amp;rsquo;s been super-frustrating since it affects my ability to work as a programmer, too. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going back to physiotherapy next week (I&amp;rsquo;ve not been back since my trip a while ago) so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to continue learning guitar without pain.&lt;/p&gt;
