      <title>Citations Needed</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/citations-needed/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of my &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/and-i-feel-fine/"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt;, er, &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/left-media-and-performative-podcasting/"&gt;radicalization&lt;/a&gt; I guess?, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of new podcasts. One in particular stands out above the rest: Citations Needed. I highly recommend you check it out (&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/citations-needed/id1258545975"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/citationsneededpodcast"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations Needed is a media criticism podcast that discusses &amp;ldquo;the history of bullshit&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned something from every episode. They bring on really knowledgeable guests, and the show is generally just really well produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most recent episode is on the subject of the US national deficit. They discuss how the media&amp;rsquo;s framing of the deficit skews towards a very narrow interpretation of monetary policy (my life is very exciting right now). But seriously ‚Äì it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode also provides some &amp;ldquo;talking points&amp;rdquo; for answering questions from angry relatives at Thanksgiving like &amp;ldquo;how can the government afford the THIRTY TWO TRILLION DOLLARS to pay for single-payer!?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="http://emaww.com/podcast/en/creating-compassionate-software-begins-engineer-ash-furrow/"&gt;recently interviewed by the Emotions Matter podcast&lt;/a&gt;, where I talked about open source, community-building, and the effects of automation on society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/344489207&amp;amp;color=ff5d61&amp;amp;hide_related=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Technology is not Neutral</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/technology-is-not-neutral/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s advertising algorithms are &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"&gt;back in the news&lt;/a&gt; after ProPublica discovered you could target antisemitic categories in your ad campaigns. The publication has &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook housing ads allowed landlords to exclude potential tenants based on their race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s break this down, from like a moral/technical perspective. What Facebook has done is it&amp;rsquo;s created a piece of &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; technology. The ad-buying algorithm is a way for ad buyers to target audiences with relevant ads, based on information Facebook has gathered or inferred from its users. That&amp;rsquo;s straightforward and certainly sounds harmless. But Facebook failed to account for how its software would be used. For how its software &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, when you create technology based on real people, your technology is necessarily imbued with the biases and prejudices of those people. When Facebook runs an algorithm to determine whose attention is worth how much, its factoring in a lot of signals from people. Those signals carry bias, so the algorithm carries bias. The same premise can be applied to machine learning, too, which also suffers from this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why when Microsoft released a &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; chat bot into Twitter, it got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist"&gt;really racist really quickly&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft failed to account for what other bot-makers already knew: without foresight and prevention, technology can/will be used in ways that violate its own creators&amp;rsquo; values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way: unless a technologist thinks ahead and puts in safeguards, they cannot control how the technology they create will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moral implications to building technology, and this is one of them: if your goal is neutrality, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; tilt the scale in favour of those people that our society marginalizes. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; overshoot towards social justice. Otherwise, your &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; technology only reinforces the existing imbalances in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is asking us to blame their algorithm for being racist, when in fact Facebook are the ones who messed up. They failed to anticipate these problems when they should have thought more carefully about how their software could be used. This should serve as a valuable lesson to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bargainville</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/bargainville/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of my oldest memories are of riding in my father&amp;rsquo;s 1998 red Toyota 4runner listening to a cassette tape of the Moxy Fr√ºvous album &lt;em&gt;Bargainville&lt;/em&gt; (1993). I was walking this morning and I put the album on and it still really speaks to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6OGn8UPY9GnwhR1068nR7x" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always fond of &lt;em&gt;River Valley&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s a catchy tune, and I grew up in a river valley. Listening to it today, during the incipient climate collapse, is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your favourite place controlled by developing ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think you&amp;rsquo;ll have some power signing a petition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you fine with your surroundings? Are they gonna crumble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I kept listening, and kept hearing the same sort of left-wing anthems come through. I mean, this seems on the nose by contemporary standards, but in the 90&amp;rsquo;s this was somewhat subversive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem had a daydream, a daydream from heaven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picked up the headline, his country was made up of singers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no more right-wingers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wakes up to &amp;ldquo;Homeless are stupid, welfare is stupid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private investment, efficiency, cool fiscal plannin&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like more Pat Buchanan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in listening to 90&amp;rsquo;s Canadian folk rock, you could do a lot worse than &lt;em&gt;Bargainville&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>And I Feel Fine</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/and-i-feel-fine/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling lately with political &amp;ldquo;feelpinions&amp;rdquo;, political opinions mostly informed by feelings. I have strong opinions about a lot of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world at the moment, but those opinions are backed by feelings instead of things like in-depth research. I just don&amp;rsquo;t have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can handle this, even when my opinions come into conflict with someone else&amp;rsquo;s. After all ‚Äì their opinions are probably not more informed than mine. But when what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; believe conflicts with mainstream narratives, life becomes hard. Reading the news or talking with colleagues is oftentimes difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Politic&amp;rsquo;s is back baby. It&amp;rsquo;s good again. Awoouu (wolf Howl)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; wint (@dril) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/568056615355740160"&gt;February 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I&amp;rsquo;d like to address the fact that that last paragraph probably sounded a bit conspiratorial. &amp;ldquo;Mainstream narratives&amp;rdquo; etc. My opinions aren&amp;rsquo;t really that extreme ‚Äì they&amp;rsquo;re just outside the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window"&gt;Overton window&lt;/a&gt;. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious to me that capitalism is wholly incapable of dealing with climate change. However, I still need to survive my day-to-day life in a society built on capitalism; it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to motivate myself to work building tools for the art market when I know that that market exists inside a system that&amp;rsquo;s thrusting our species towards its inescapable doom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And, obviously, I need to acknowledge that interacting with the rest of society has been even more difficult lately because of &lt;a href="/blog/some-updates/"&gt;some recent life changes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me cope, and maybe to let others of similar opinions know that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone, I&amp;rsquo;m going to rapid-fire some political feelpinions I have that go against the grain of what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; ‚Äì opinions I have that I haven&amp;rsquo;t necessarily interrogated in-depth, but opinions I hold nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism is responsible for a massive amount of worldwide suffering, and this suffering overwhelmingly affects women, people of colour, people living in poverty, and members of other marginalized groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change is going to continue getting worse, and will get more worse more quickly as time goes on. Our species is likely headed to extinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dsausa.org"&gt;Democratic Socialists of America&lt;/a&gt; are a cool organization, but are not without their flaws. They do &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neworleansdsa/status/901549034699194369"&gt;good work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many criticisms of Hillary Clinton are based in (and motivated by) misogyny. This fact is used by centrists to stifle legitimate criticisms of her policies. (For in-depth feminist critique of Clinton&amp;rsquo;s policies, check out &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2jbPzwd"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many criticisms of Israel are based in (and motivated by) antisemitism. This fact is used by centrists to stifle legitimate criticisms of the country&amp;rsquo;s policies. After all, Israel is a country, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; countries&amp;rsquo; policies have flaws, therefore Israel&amp;rsquo;s policies have flaws. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a controversial statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Democratic Party is deeply, deeply flawed. Probably irreparably. They represent the interests of their donors first and foremost, and have failed to offer a meaningful resistance to the rise of fascism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2016 Clinton presidential campaign banked too heavily on &amp;ldquo;not being Donald Trump&amp;rdquo; instead of presenting appealing social policies (for example, single payer health care).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! That felt good. Certainly not an exhaustive list. If you agree with any of these, that&amp;rsquo;s cool. If not, don&amp;rsquo;t @ me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world, baby!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Updates</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/some-updates/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bit of a personal post, but wanted to updated after some tweets I made about my medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Recently found the perfect Rx combo to help me with depression. Works really well for me. Tuesday, I had to stop b/c a serious side-effect üòî&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; the javascript lover (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/901838857683038212"&gt;August 27, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things have been going really well for me (which I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;a href="/blog/therapys-end/"&gt;recently written about&lt;/a&gt;) and this medication change kind of came out of the blue. It sucks to find a groove and then have it disrupted, but life is a journey and there are lots of other medications I can try. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that the adverse side-effect that required me to suddenly stop taking one of my meds aren&amp;rsquo;t permanent (it&amp;rsquo;s a neurological problem, so it might be). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I went off this medication (which was a tapered change and not a hard stop, like this time) &lt;a href="/blog/feelings-are-hard/"&gt;things got really hard really quickly&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly two weeks now and while I&amp;rsquo;m definitely feeling down, but I&amp;rsquo;m also being proactive about managing the imminent mood problems. For example, I find getting out the door in the mornings to be difficult, and it kind of sets the tone for the whole day. So I have a schedule written out of what exactly to do in the mornings, including some self-care to make sure my mood stays stable throughout the day. It&amp;rsquo;s been helping a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. We&amp;rsquo;ll see. I&amp;rsquo;m in high spirits, for now, but like I&amp;rsquo;ve said before: I&amp;rsquo;ve got a supportive partner, friends, and work environment. I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine, just need to remember that I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
