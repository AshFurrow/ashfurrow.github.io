      <title>Weekend Hack Project: Twelease</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/node-express-typescript/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using technologies like &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://expressjs.com"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; at Artsy for a while now, contributing new features or fixing bugs to various codebases. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever gone through the full process of having an idea, starting a new project, building a minimum-deployable-product, and shipping it off to a server. I was less prepared for this than I&amp;rsquo;d thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I give an overview of steps I followed, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a tutorial. It is a reflection on the contrasts between the iOS developer experience and the JavaScript developer experience. All the code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like using small projects to learn new things. Limited-scope projects are great to build without getting too overwhelmed by complexity. An open source project &lt;a href="https://github.com/danger/danger-js/issues/332"&gt;wanted to tweet when they pushed a new GitHub tag&lt;/a&gt;; only slightly more complicated than an IFTTT rule, perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where to start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, after opening Xcode and selecting a project template, you have an entire app. You can compile and run it as-is and there&amp;rsquo;s tonnes of helpful comments about where to add certain pieces of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Xcode for JavaScript, so how you decide to build your app is &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; up to you. It can be difficult to choose a methodology because there is an entire community of strong opinions about how to build software. And while projects like &lt;a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app"&gt;Create React Native App&lt;/a&gt; offer an equivalent experience of a new project template, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that the frameworks you use in JavaScript are only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m using Express, but I prefer using a strong type system. No problem, I&amp;rsquo;ll use TypeScript! Okay, so now I have to integrate an entire build system into my workflows for developing, testing, and deploying, and holy shit I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Express before, but I copy/pasted a basic Hello, World project anyway. Then I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/Gisonrg/express-github-webhook"&gt;a library&lt;/a&gt; that provides middleware to process and verify GitHub webhook events. Great! Let&amp;rsquo;s smash the two together, LHC-style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I work, I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of building, then running, my code. So I add &lt;a href="https://gulpjs.com"&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt; to watch the filesystem and re-run the TypeScript compiler whenever I change &lt;code&gt;.ts&lt;/code&gt; files. I also specify an output directory of &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; because that seems to be what everyone else does. (&lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t checked in to git, it&amp;rsquo;s basically like your Xcode app archives.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulp is configured via execution of &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease/blob/master/gulpfile.js"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gulpfile.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - like a Gemfile or Podfile, while TypeScript is configured through &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease/blob/master/tsconfig.json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Quirky difference – but it makes sense. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how flexible all the tools are – you can configure tools on the command line, through config files, or through environment variables. The easiest is through the config files, but they all need to be strictly valid JSON. The strictness of JSON was a bit frustrating, to be honest, especially the lack of comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also needed to get fancy about how Heroku gets deployed by adding &lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;node&amp;quot;]]&lt;/code&gt; to my TypeScript config. Oh, and also a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease/blob/1f233ba4aa8004958379e073232cc9b72b395c47/package.json#L41"&gt;&lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt; script&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the TypeScript compilation would fail on Heroku. And I wanted to compile the TypeScript &lt;em&gt;on deploy&lt;/em&gt; and not as part of the server startup. Oh, and I made sure Heroku&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; points to the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; (which is the compiled version of &lt;code&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your background, these details might seem either so trivial as to be hardly worth mentioning, or so complex that you might feel overwhelmed. And with no community authority like Apple providing a clear path for beginners, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get stuck on random configuration problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I also happen to disagree with a lot of Apple&amp;rsquo;s vision for how to develop software. Not just methodology, like MVC, but also build tools. For instance, Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://isxcodeopensourceyet.github.io"&gt;Xcode IDE is closed source&lt;/a&gt;, and has very minimal support for extensions. Many community projects, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"&gt;swiftlint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten"&gt;sourcekitten&lt;/a&gt;, do help improve the iOS development experience, but iOS developers tend to rely exclusively on Apple tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the JS tooling ecosystem is alive with a variety of linters, type-checkers, formatters, file watchers, test runners, and more. Yes, it is a little overwhelming, and yes, your initial project setup is a lot harder than a new project template from Xcode, but the JS community seems to believe that a little extra upfront work is well worth improving the development experience long term. Having worked in both the iOS and JS ecosystems, I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just a variety of tools is the size of the community that builds them. Because JavaScript developers mainly use tools written &lt;em&gt;in JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;, the initial barrier of contributing to those tools is enormously lowered. The community empowers its members to improve the shared tooling, and the results are spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let’s flip the tables: how empowering would it feel if your app’s API was written in Swift? You’d be able to fix your own bugs, add features&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pablo Picasghost👻 (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/914247587984687104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cycle of compiling Swift/Objective-C to run unit tests adds a lot of time to my iOS development process. It takes time to compile, install, and run tests. If you have to wait fifteen seconds to see if your code works, you won&amp;rsquo;t check as often. In contrast, &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/"&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; make testing &lt;em&gt;unbelievably fast&lt;/em&gt;. Using Jest to test fundamentally changed how I write code, and I miss the near-instant feedback cycle when I return to iOS native development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript community moves at a blistering pace. That means I can&amp;rsquo;t just learn the current JS syntax because most tutorials, StackOverflow answers, and blog posts use older syntaxes that I also need to learn. For example, dependencies used to be loaded into a file with &lt;code&gt;require()&lt;/code&gt; but now most folks seem to use &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;. But &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t work for me in the Node REPL, I had to still use &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I really dig about JavaScript is how you import all your dependencies explicitly; you import specifically &amp;ldquo;exported&amp;rdquo; functions and such from modules. Some modules export named functions, while other modules export a &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; function. Some do both. Here are a few examples of how to import stuff in JS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'./lib/loggers'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'auth'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'./twitter'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all makes sense to read, but I still don&amp;rsquo;t have the mechanics internalized enough to write the syntax right on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One neat thing I like about working in Artsy&amp;rsquo;s JS codebases is their use of git pre-commit hooks. Often, these hooks will lint and reformat your code for you to adhere to the repo&amp;rsquo;s standard. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll run any tests related to your staged changes. Very handy stuff for catching mistakes earlier in the development process. For whatever reason, automatic code formatters just haven&amp;rsquo;t been popular among iOS developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I have my app set up and working, but with all the experimentation with tools and frameworks, I&amp;rsquo;m certain that I&amp;rsquo;ve left in some orphaned configuration or dependencies that I no longer need. Or maybe I have some developer dependencies in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease/blob/master/package.json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;. Or some leftover &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to accumulate all this stuff. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll go shake it out. If you see anything funky &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/twelease"&gt;in the repo&lt;/a&gt;, let me know in an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a few mysteries I&amp;rsquo;m looking to solve, like precisely how &lt;code&gt;es-lint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ts-lint&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;prettier&lt;/code&gt; relate to one another. Stuff like that, quirks I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed or other common knowledge that people don&amp;rsquo;t tend to write blog posts about. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript and iOS developer communities are very different places. iOS developers have Apple setting the vision for how to build apps, whereas JS developers have an &lt;em&gt;overwhelming&lt;/em&gt; number of options. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I can work in both communities – I like and dislike things about each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial setup of the project, toolchain, and workflows was difficult enough to frustrate me a few times. It will be a lot easier next time. But the improved development workflow makes writing software way easier, way faster, and way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of this has resonated with you, Mozilla has some &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs"&gt;comprehensive documentation&lt;/a&gt; around setting up a development environment to write a &lt;code&gt;Hello, World&lt;/code&gt; app in Express. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about TypeScript for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of something you&amp;rsquo;d like to build, and try to build it. Make sure your idea is really easy, because building it will probably actually be hard, and you might not finish, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay because you&amp;rsquo;ll have learned a lot. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll have some fun. I sure did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citations Needed</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/citations-needed/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a part of my &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/and-i-feel-fine/"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt;, er, &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/left-media-and-performative-podcasting/"&gt;radicalization&lt;/a&gt; I guess?, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of new podcasts. One in particular stands out above the rest: Citations Needed. I highly recommend you check it out (&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/citations-needed/id1258545975"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/citationsneededpodcast"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations Needed is a media criticism podcast that discusses &amp;ldquo;the history of bullshit&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned something from every episode. They bring on really knowledgeable guests, and the show is generally just really well produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most recent episode is on the subject of the US national deficit. They discuss how the media&amp;rsquo;s framing of the deficit skews towards a very narrow interpretation of monetary policy (my life is very exciting right now). But seriously – it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode also provides some &amp;ldquo;talking points&amp;rdquo; for answering questions from angry relatives at Thanksgiving like &amp;ldquo;how can the government afford the THIRTY TWO TRILLION DOLLARS to pay for single-payer!?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/344260297&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="http://emaww.com/podcast/en/creating-compassionate-software-begins-engineer-ash-furrow/"&gt;recently interviewed by the Emotions Matter podcast&lt;/a&gt;, where I talked about open source, community-building, and the effects of automation on society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/344489207&amp;amp;color=ff5d61&amp;amp;hide_related=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Technology is not Neutral</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/technology-is-not-neutral/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s advertising algorithms are &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"&gt;back in the news&lt;/a&gt; after ProPublica discovered you could target antisemitic categories in your ad campaigns. The publication has &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook housing ads allowed landlords to exclude potential tenants based on their race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s break this down, from like a moral/technical perspective. What Facebook has done is it&amp;rsquo;s created a piece of &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; technology. The ad-buying algorithm is a way for ad buyers to target audiences with relevant ads, based on information Facebook has gathered or inferred from its users. That&amp;rsquo;s straightforward and certainly sounds harmless. But Facebook failed to account for how its software would be used. For how its software &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, when you create technology based on real people, your technology is necessarily imbued with the biases and prejudices of those people. When Facebook runs an algorithm to determine whose attention is worth how much, its factoring in a lot of signals from people. Those signals carry bias, so the algorithm carries bias. The same premise can be applied to machine learning, too, which also suffers from this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why when Microsoft released a &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; chat bot into Twitter, it got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist"&gt;really racist really quickly&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft failed to account for what other bot-makers already knew: without foresight and prevention, technology can/will be used in ways that violate its own creators&amp;rsquo; values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way: unless a technologist thinks ahead and puts in safeguards, they cannot control how the technology they create will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moral implications to building technology, and this is one of them: if your goal is neutrality, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; tilt the scale in favour of those people that our society marginalizes. You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; overshoot towards social justice. Otherwise, your &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; technology only reinforces the existing imbalances in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is asking us to blame their algorithm for being racist, when in fact Facebook are the ones who messed up. They failed to anticipate these problems when they should have thought more carefully about how their software could be used. This should serve as a valuable lesson to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bargainville</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/bargainville/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of my oldest memories are of riding in my father&amp;rsquo;s 1998 red Toyota 4runner listening to a cassette tape of the Moxy Früvous album &lt;em&gt;Bargainville&lt;/em&gt; (1993). I was walking this morning and I put the album on and it still really speaks to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6OGn8UPY9GnwhR1068nR7x" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always fond of &lt;em&gt;River Valley&lt;/em&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s a catchy tune, and I grew up in a river valley. Listening to it today, during the incipient climate collapse, is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your favourite place controlled by developing ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think you&amp;rsquo;ll have some power signing a petition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you fine with your surroundings? Are they gonna crumble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I kept listening, and kept hearing the same sort of left-wing anthems come through. I mean, this seems on the nose by contemporary standards, but in the 90&amp;rsquo;s this was somewhat subversive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem had a daydream, a daydream from heaven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picked up the headline, his country was made up of singers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no more right-wingers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wakes up to &amp;ldquo;Homeless are stupid, welfare is stupid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private investment, efficiency, cool fiscal plannin&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like more Pat Buchanan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in listening to 90&amp;rsquo;s Canadian folk rock, you could do a lot worse than &lt;em&gt;Bargainville&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>And I Feel Fine</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/and-i-feel-fine/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling lately with political &amp;ldquo;feelpinions&amp;rdquo;, political opinions mostly informed by feelings. I have strong opinions about a lot of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world at the moment, but those opinions are backed by feelings instead of things like in-depth research. I just don&amp;rsquo;t have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can handle this, even when my opinions come into conflict with someone else&amp;rsquo;s. After all – their opinions are probably not more informed than mine. But when what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; believe conflicts with mainstream narratives, life becomes hard. Reading the news or talking with colleagues is oftentimes difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Politic&amp;rsquo;s is back baby. It&amp;rsquo;s good again. Awoouu (wolf Howl)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; wint (@dril) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/568056615355740160"&gt;February 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I&amp;rsquo;d like to address the fact that that last paragraph probably sounded a bit conspiratorial. &amp;ldquo;Mainstream narratives&amp;rdquo; etc. My opinions aren&amp;rsquo;t really that extreme – they&amp;rsquo;re just outside the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window"&gt;Overton window&lt;/a&gt;. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious to me that capitalism is wholly incapable of dealing with climate change. However, I still need to survive my day-to-day life in a society built on capitalism; it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to motivate myself to work building tools for the art market when I know that that market exists inside a system that&amp;rsquo;s thrusting our species towards its inescapable doom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And, obviously, I need to acknowledge that interacting with the rest of society has been even more difficult lately because of &lt;a href="/blog/some-updates/"&gt;some recent life changes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me cope, and maybe to let others of similar opinions know that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone, I&amp;rsquo;m going to rapid-fire some political feelpinions I have that go against the grain of what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; – opinions I have that I haven&amp;rsquo;t necessarily interrogated in-depth, but opinions I hold nevertheless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalism is responsible for a massive amount of worldwide suffering, and this suffering overwhelmingly affects women, people of colour, people living in poverty, and members of other marginalized groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change is going to continue getting worse, and will get more worse more quickly as time goes on. Our species is likely headed to extinction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dsausa.org"&gt;Democratic Socialists of America&lt;/a&gt; are a cool organization, but are not without their flaws. They do &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neworleansdsa/status/901549034699194369"&gt;good work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many criticisms of Hillary Clinton are based in (and motivated by) misogyny. This fact is used by centrists to stifle legitimate criticisms of her policies. (For in-depth feminist critique of Clinton&amp;rsquo;s policies, check out &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2jbPzwd"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many criticisms of Israel are based in (and motivated by) antisemitism. This fact is used by centrists to stifle legitimate criticisms of the country&amp;rsquo;s policies. After all, Israel is a country, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; countries&amp;rsquo; policies have flaws, therefore Israel&amp;rsquo;s policies have flaws. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a controversial statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Democratic Party is deeply, deeply flawed. Probably irreparably. They represent the interests of their donors first and foremost, and have failed to offer a meaningful resistance to the rise of fascism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2016 Clinton presidential campaign banked too heavily on &amp;ldquo;not being Donald Trump&amp;rdquo; instead of presenting appealing social policies (for example, single payer health care).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! That felt good. Certainly not an exhaustive list. If you agree with any of these, that&amp;rsquo;s cool. If not, don&amp;rsquo;t @ me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world, baby!&lt;/p&gt;
