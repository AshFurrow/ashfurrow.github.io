      <title>Hitting a Guitar Stride</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/hitting-a-guitar-stride/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months since I bought an acoustic Guitar and &lt;a href="/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;started teaching myself&lt;/a&gt; using the Internet. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an electric guitar too, found an instructor, taken a few lessons, and started recording myself to track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music has been challenging, rewarding, and fun! The last few months in America have sucked, and music has for sure helped me get through some challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be worth looking back on how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come, because I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve recently hit a stride in learning new skills on the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, learning songs was really hard because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to learning the new chords, the rhythm, the lyrics, everything. But as I repeated the learning process over and over, I got better at it. A few weeks ago, I started learning one of my favourite songs and it went a lot easier than other, less challenging songs had gone. Within a week I had gotten to the point I was really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323809759&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learning has gotten easier because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it more, but there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than just that. I feel like each additional skill I learn can be combined with every skill I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned; so there&amp;rsquo;s a combinatorial explosion of ability. A sort of &lt;code&gt;n!&lt;/code&gt; effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about all this was this video below. It&amp;rsquo;s a tutorial from a show I watch that teaches a song; it has a tonne of chords, most of which are new to me, and I would&amp;rsquo;ve been really intimidating to learn even a month ago. Instead, when I found it last weekend I was really excited to learn all the new skills because it means I can connect each one to each other one I already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/LbKPWRxtok0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song has helped me get better at barre chords, descending baseline notes over chords, barre chord slides, muting, strumming speed, all kinds of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly challenging song, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a tonne of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting better and better at guitar (and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it more and more), my wrist pain this week has been really bad. It&amp;rsquo;s been super-frustrating since it affects my ability to work as a programmer, too. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going back to physiotherapy next week (I&amp;rsquo;ve not been back since my trip a while ago) so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to continue learning guitar without pain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stepping Back from Moya</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/stepping-back-from-moya/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I gave &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/102858222"&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of building open source communities. I ended the presentation with the announcement that I&amp;rsquo;m stepping back from the Moya community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height="420" width="100%" src="//www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/102858222?html5ui" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="border: 0 none transparent;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk goes into detail about how open source maintainers should distribute their power and responsibilities as early as possible. Because the fact is, eventually you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be ready to move on to your next project. Your goal as a maintainer really should be to create a project that can outlive your interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent two and a half years focusing on the community of Moya, rather than just the codebase, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the team of core contributors that are ready to take over for me. They have my full confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to move on from your next project, you&amp;rsquo;ve built up a community ready to take over for you, too. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breath of the Wild &amp; The Switch</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/breath-of-the-wild-switch/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled with video games. I love them but could &lt;a href="/blog/the-joys-and-sorrows-of-being-an-almost-gamer/"&gt;never quite clear the skills curve&lt;/a&gt; of the types of games I enjoyed: role-playing games. So I&amp;rsquo;d get through a good chunk of the game, get really invested in the characters and story, and then get stuck and give up in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/blog/the-redemption-of-the-almost-gamer/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I felt good while playing games was to do with &lt;em&gt;Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It really got me into a flow state and kept me there and I loved it. I&amp;rsquo;ve replayed &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; on 3DS and beat it, and it felt amazing. So I&amp;rsquo;ve changed, and Zelda&amp;rsquo;s changed, and I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about how I might get on with contemporary Zelda games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what&amp;rsquo;s basically a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI"&gt;flawless product video&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch was announced six months ago. And I knew I would get one eventually. Because just look at that thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/f5uik5fgIaI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t buy game consoles – and I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t buy them early – because I Am Not A Gamer. But this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different. Both &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, the new Zelda game, and the Switch had me so excited that I got one only a few months after it launched. And I&amp;rsquo;m blown away by both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Switch is amazing, hardware wise. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a super-beefy tablet that plays Nintendo games and has a decent host OS. The little controllers (&amp;ldquo;joy cons&amp;rdquo;) are great. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing mostly with the Switch connected to a TV, and I use the joy cons independently of one another, which is cool. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to get the one-piece pro controller and see how it feels, since I&amp;rsquo;m playing a lot (and so is Ashley). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m really excited for is &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone I know who has played it has been blown away, and based on the overwhelming positive response, I&amp;rsquo;ve been super-pumped. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/breath-of-the-wild-switch/botw.jpg" alt="More like Breath the Fresh Air amirite" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you my review by saying I agree with &lt;a href="http://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174"&gt;the spirit of this one&lt;/a&gt;. I love that there are different ways to solve every puzzle, but more than that: I love that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to beat the game without solving &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; puzzle. If I get stuck, it&amp;rsquo;s okay because I can come back later, or never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; kind of normalizes the fact that you&amp;rsquo;ll die. And I have. A lot. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay because the game&amp;rsquo;s autosave does a great job of making sure I never loose much progress. Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/859467299320999937"&gt;initially frustrated&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the game because it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult until you have levelled up a bit. But after that hump (which I cleared this time, awww yeah) it&amp;rsquo;s super-fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Games. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll always be casual gamer but I&amp;rsquo;m really into what Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s doing right now. The Switch is an actual console, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be a gateway into other, more serious games that get ported to it. I&amp;rsquo;m excited!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributing to Mastodon</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/contributing-to-mastodon/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So Mastodon. Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running an instance for weeks now and it&amp;rsquo;s been great! Some tensions, some conflicts, but overall very rewarding and worth any costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/ashfurrow"&gt;My Patreon&lt;/a&gt; to pay for server costs is fully funded, the &lt;a href="/blog/moving-mastodon-to-digital-ocean/"&gt;switch to Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; has gone smoothly, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve begun looking for more ways to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s my birthday, but I got you a present: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hixblpmg5A"&gt;https://t.co/Hixblpmg5A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Federated Furrow (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/853645778463723520"&gt;April 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the web is &lt;a href="/blog/the-web-and-mastodon/"&gt;something we create&lt;/a&gt;, and I want to help create Mastodon. Yeah I do that by hosting an instance, but I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer and I love to build things. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been picking off easy issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon"&gt;on the repo&lt;/a&gt;, gradually moving towards harder ones. I took a look at all &lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pulls?utf8=✓&amp;amp;q=%20author%3Aashfurrow%20"&gt;the issues/pull requests I&amp;rsquo;ve opened&lt;/a&gt;, and wow. I&amp;rsquo;m getting to know the project better and better over time, including things outside the codebase. The creator granted me rights to manage GitHub issues, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been deduplicating bug reports, reviewing pull requests, and labelling issues. It&amp;rsquo;s been great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the developer community has been welcoming, the Mastodon project (and leadership) have been straining under the stress of Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s meteoric rise in popularity. What&amp;rsquo;s nice is that they&amp;rsquo;re being very conscientious and thoughtful about how to address &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@alliethehart/gameingers-are-dead-and-so-is-mastodon-705b535ed616"&gt;concerns from the community&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have lots of experience in open source community management, I&amp;rsquo;ve never led a project operating at this scale, so I&amp;rsquo;m mostly listening and only offering advice where appropriate.  I think this is especially important, as I live many dimensions of privilege, and the project started and continues to be run by many people of marginalized groups. Even the ability to donate my time to Mastodon is a form of privilege, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be conscientious of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to continuing to learn about Rails, React, and the Mastodon community. It&amp;rsquo;s been a blast so far, despite being challenging, and I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to stop any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Web and Mastodon</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/the-web-and-mastodon/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/glitch/the-web-was-supposed-to-be-a-thing-we-make-c023b6e7f56a"&gt;blog post from Glitch&lt;/a&gt; about their graphic design, and something in it really struck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget in an era of billion-dollar Internet startups that the original vision of the web was that it’s something we make, not just something we consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web: something we make, not just something we consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hit me because I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon/"&gt;running a Mastodon instance&lt;/a&gt; for two weeks. Let me explain. Beyond administering a tech-focused instance, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been contributing to their community with added documentation, new ideas, and code. It&amp;rsquo;s been an incredibly rewarding experience, in large part because of the community. Being a part of Mastodon feels like being a part of something much bigger than just myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is the Web at its best. I&amp;rsquo;m building a space, the community is building social norms, it&amp;rsquo;s so participatory and so refreshing and so rewarding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit tired of pundits wringing their hands about Mastodon: &amp;ldquo;will it be a success?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how can it beat Twitter?&amp;rdquo;, blah blah blah. Who cares? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One article &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/is-mastodon-the-new-social-media-star-or-imploding-black-hole/"&gt;cuts to the heart&lt;/a&gt; of pundits&amp;rsquo; problematic hot takes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therein lies the issues for brands who want to join this new network and advertise to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh, who cares about brands. We – me and the other Mastodonians – are making something &lt;em&gt;for us&lt;/em&gt; and not for brands. Sorry if that offends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastodon isn&amp;rsquo;t defined by its relation to Twitter or to Facebook or to Snapchat. It&amp;rsquo;s not trying to be anything other than what it is. The developers are doing this because they like it. The admins are doing this because they like it. The users are doing this because they like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave us out of your hot takes, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying things are perfect – there are tensions and conflicts in any community – but the fediverse feels so much happier and friendly than Twitter has for years. Maybe ever. It&amp;rsquo;s the salad days of Mastodon, just enjoy it! Aww yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Mastodon to Digital Ocean</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/moving-mastodon-to-digital-ocean/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning &lt;a href="/blog/mastodon-hosting-migration-plan/"&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; my plans to move from hosting &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;my mastodon instance&lt;/a&gt; on Heroku to hosting it on AWS. Well I got some feedback, and I did some thinking, and I changed my plan, and then I actually did the whole thing! I&amp;rsquo;m now hosting on &lt;a href="https://m.do.co/c/4a83a8a7aedf"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (referral link) and I kind of love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary reason for moving hosts was cost. I really like Heroku, but you pay a premium for the convenience of it. That&amp;rsquo;s why I planned to switch to AWS, but &lt;em&gt;turns out&lt;/em&gt; you can end up paying a lot for convenience on AWS, too. I found there were comparable costs for Redis and Postgres services between Heroku and AWS, the those were the two things I was expecting to save the most on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that you save money when you roll up your sleeves and start administer your own database, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how much. Luckily, the Mastodon developers know administrating stuff is hard, so they have support for &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker is &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a virtual machine (don&amp;rsquo;t @ me) and the Mastodon developers include what are basically recipes for Docker containers to be built from, and to run from. Combined with &lt;a href="http://digitalmind.io/post/deploying-mastodon-on-digital-ocean"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to get a test instance of Mastodon up within a half hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, wow, that amazed me. I&amp;rsquo;ve historically had a lot of trouble deploying stuff, and this was amazing. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how quickly I had something working. But enough gushing over Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally had a complicated migration strategy. Originally. Then, instead of doing a bunch of complicated configuration to get zero-or-near-zero downtime, I just took the instance down. The whole process took twenty minutes, and would have been shorter but I ran into problems importing the Postgres database backup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things went well! I&amp;rsquo;ve got SSL set up like before, and also gained IPv6 support. Somehow, I guess, I lost the Redis database? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but things are working well enough that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are things working? Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a response time graph anymore but interactions feel a little slower. CPU utilization is peaking at 30%, and RAM is near 30% as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about the costs? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m currently running on a $40/month virtual machine, plus some backup, S3, and Mailgun costs, so I&amp;rsquo;m pegging it at $50–60, or about a third of what I was paying on Heroku. The VM has 4GB of RAM, 2 virtual CPUs, 30GB of SSD space, and 4TB of network transfer a month. Not bad! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constellation of Heroku Dynos and Add-Ons has been reduced to one virtual computer running contains each for Sidekiq, Rails-on-Puma, Redis, and Postgres. Everything is stored to the main disk but I may take a look at Digital Ocean&amp;rsquo;s dedicated storage volumes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave it running as-is and look at tuning or reducing costs until I have a solid baseline of how things are working. I kind of miss my Papertrail logs and my response time graphs, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably customize the code a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
