      <title>Mastodon Interview</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-interview/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;: still a thing. And &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;my instance&lt;/a&gt;, also still a thing! Recently, one of the users on mastodon.technology sat down and &lt;a href="http://www.smays.com/2017/06/ash-furrow/"&gt;interviewed me&lt;/a&gt; about the platform and the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/x3FEs8sgXjE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My participation in Mastodon hasn&amp;rsquo;t been steady, but neither was my participation in Twitter at first. I&amp;rsquo;m still finding my feet and my voice there. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what the future holds; this is still an experiment, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where we end up together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why My Eyes Gently Roll</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/why-my-eyes-gently-roll/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, an article from the Washington Post titled &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/lifestyle/the-slow-secret-death-of-the-electric-guitar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why my guitar gently weeps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; made its way around the internet&amp;rsquo;s various music circles. The article makes some noise about falling guitar sales and draws conclusions from interviews that the author conducted with various captains of industry; its thesis is that sales are trending down, the industry is shrinking, and a lack of &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; is to blame. Young people ‚Äì apparently ‚Äì just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough rock stars to look up to and emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to read the post (it&amp;rsquo;s not long) prepare yourself for some extreme eye-rolling. Also, the article uses some weird JavaScript scroll hijacking, so have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as an aside, the article mentions a shift towards more women and girls learning guitar, but brushes their increased interest aside as trivial ‚Äì or based purely in aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Mooney, the Fender CEO, calls [Taylor] Swift ‚Äúthe most influential guitarist of recent years.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that young girls looked at Taylor and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really impressed by the way she plays G major arpeggios.‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Mooney says. ‚ÄúThey liked how she looked, and they wanted to emulate her.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds dismissive. After all, young folks of the past were focused &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the sounds of musicians and not their looks (for example, this is why KISS is known for wearing only dull boring outfits during performances). Girls don&amp;rsquo;t care about music, just about looks. Uh huh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a writing perspective, the biggest weakness of the article is that the author neglected to include perspectives from actual &lt;em&gt;guitarists&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, Geoff Edgars tacitly implies that falling guitar sales = declining industry = declining guitar popularity. A lot of folks around guitar forums and YouTube have pointed out this fallacy, and they further refute the claim that there are no &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; by offering their own list of popular players. Usually men. Actually, all men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that just maybe our society has some kind of problem with attitudes towards women.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with the musicians&amp;rsquo; rebuttal, that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still &amp;ldquo;guitar heroes&amp;rdquo; (gosh I dislike that term). I can name a few bands that really influenced my decision to pick up the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there&amp;rsquo;s such an abundance of educational resources on learning guitar that, since starting in December, I&amp;rsquo;ve at times felt overwhelmed by just how much there is to learn, and just how many ways there are to learn it all. I would be interested in reading an article discussing these resources, the rising popularity of YouTube as a music education platform, and hearing from a variety of musicians (of all genders) about their perspectives on the guitar industry&amp;rsquo;s decline. But that would require the Washington Post to investigate ‚Äì which is apparently too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feelings are Hard</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/feelings-are-hard/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things have been getting to me lately. Big things, little things, all kinds of things. The result is: I get upset. Angry even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaand because I insist on spending so much of my life on Twitter (I need to stop that&amp;hellip;) everyone gets to see me get upset at things. The latest problems in my life are bringing the wrong computer cable and the LEGO store being sold out of something I want. Pretty childish stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Ash, sounds like you‚Äôre not having the best day. Here‚Äôs a box of fucking adorable goddamn kittens. It‚Äôll help you on your way. &lt;a href="https://t.co/92nzKdfbFB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/92nzKdfbFB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Aaron Vegh üìé (@aaronvegh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aaronvegh/status/875051392515403784"&gt;June 14, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, things were going great until about six weeks ago when my doctor suggested going off one of my medications. I&amp;rsquo;m on a very small dose, and we wanted to see if I needed it. Turns out I desperately do. Within a week I was miserable, flat, depressed. I finally got back on the medication, and as soon as it kicked in, I caught a cold. So I&amp;rsquo;m back to feeling miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing guitar can help, except my wrists hurt too much to play. So I get a little more sad. Sleeping helps, I feel better in the mornings. Doing things helps, so I feel better when I make it to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the sort of back drop for this emotional rollercoaster is the political landscape of 2017. What a shitty year it&amp;rsquo;s been and promises to continue to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be okay ‚Äì I have a supportive partner, and a therapist, and a psychiatrist. And I&amp;rsquo;m making progress all the time. I&amp;rsquo;ve just had such a hard time over the past month or so. This summer was supposed to be refreshing and exciting, but instead it&amp;rsquo;s began with familiar ennui. Things are looking up, I guess, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help feel like I&amp;rsquo;m going to be stuck here forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hitting a Guitar Stride</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/hitting-a-guitar-stride/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months since I bought an acoustic Guitar and &lt;a href="/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;started teaching myself&lt;/a&gt; using the Internet. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an electric guitar too, found an instructor, taken a few lessons, and started recording myself to track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music has been challenging, rewarding, and fun! The last few months in America have sucked, and music has for sure helped me get through some challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be worth looking back on how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come, because I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve recently hit a stride in learning new skills on the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, learning songs was really hard because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to learning the new chords, the rhythm, the lyrics, everything. But as I repeated the learning process over and over, I got better at it. A few weeks ago, I started learning one of my favourite songs and it went a lot easier than other, less challenging songs had gone. Within a week I had gotten to the point I was really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/323809759&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learning has gotten easier because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it more, but there&amp;rsquo;s more to it than just that. I feel like each additional skill I learn can be combined with every skill I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned; so there&amp;rsquo;s a combinatorial explosion of ability. A sort of &lt;code&gt;n!&lt;/code&gt; effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about all this was this video below. It&amp;rsquo;s a tutorial from a show I watch that teaches a song; it has a tonne of chords, most of which are new to me, and I would&amp;rsquo;ve been really intimidating to learn even a month ago. Instead, when I found it last weekend I was really excited to learn all the new skills because it means I can connect each one to each other one I already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/LbKPWRxtok0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song has helped me get better at barre chords, descending baseline notes over chords, barre chord slides, muting, strumming speed, all kinds of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly challenging song, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a tonne of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting better and better at guitar (and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it more and more), my wrist pain this week has been really bad. It&amp;rsquo;s been super-frustrating since it affects my ability to work as a programmer, too. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going back to physiotherapy next week (I&amp;rsquo;ve not been back since my trip a while ago) so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to continue learning guitar without pain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stepping Back from Moya</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/stepping-back-from-moya/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I gave &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/102858222"&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of building open source communities. I ended the presentation with the announcement that I&amp;rsquo;m stepping back from the Moya community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height="420" width="100%" src="//www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/102858222?html5ui" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="border: 0 none transparent;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk goes into detail about how open source maintainers should distribute their power and responsibilities as early as possible. Because the fact is, eventually you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be ready to move on to your next project. Your goal as a maintainer really should be to create a project that can outlive your interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent two and a half years focusing on the community of Moya, rather than just the codebase, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the team of core contributors that are ready to take over for me. They have my full confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to move on from your next project, you&amp;rsquo;ve built up a community ready to take over for you, too. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breath of the Wild &amp; The Switch</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/breath-of-the-wild-switch/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled with video games. I love them but could &lt;a href="/blog/the-joys-and-sorrows-of-being-an-almost-gamer/"&gt;never quite clear the skills curve&lt;/a&gt; of the types of games I enjoyed: role-playing games. So I&amp;rsquo;d get through a good chunk of the game, get really invested in the characters and story, and then get stuck and give up in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/blog/the-redemption-of-the-almost-gamer/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I felt good while playing games was to do with &lt;em&gt;Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It really got me into a flow state and kept me there and I loved it. I&amp;rsquo;ve replayed &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; on 3DS and beat it, and it felt amazing. So I&amp;rsquo;ve changed, and Zelda&amp;rsquo;s changed, and I&amp;rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about how I might get on with contemporary Zelda games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what&amp;rsquo;s basically a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI"&gt;flawless product video&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch was announced six months ago. And I knew I would get one eventually. Because just look at that thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/f5uik5fgIaI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t buy game consoles ‚Äì and I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t buy them early ‚Äì because I Am Not A Gamer. But this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different. Both &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, the new Zelda game, and the Switch had me so excited that I got one only a few months after it launched. And I&amp;rsquo;m blown away by both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Switch is amazing, hardware wise. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a super-beefy tablet that plays Nintendo games and has a decent host OS. The little controllers (&amp;ldquo;joy cons&amp;rdquo;) are great. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing mostly with the Switch connected to a TV, and I use the joy cons independently of one another, which is cool. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to get the one-piece pro controller and see how it feels, since I&amp;rsquo;m playing a lot (and so is Ashley). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m really excited for is &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone I know who has played it has been blown away, and based on the overwhelming positive response, I&amp;rsquo;ve been super-pumped. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/breath-of-the-wild-switch/botw.jpg" alt="More like Breath the Fresh Air amirite" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you my review by saying I agree with &lt;a href="http://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174"&gt;the spirit of this one&lt;/a&gt;. I love that there are different ways to solve every puzzle, but more than that: I love that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to beat the game without solving &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; puzzle. If I get stuck, it&amp;rsquo;s okay because I can come back later, or never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; kind of normalizes the fact that you&amp;rsquo;ll die. And I have. A lot. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay because the game&amp;rsquo;s autosave does a great job of making sure I never loose much progress. Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/859467299320999937"&gt;initially frustrated&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the game because it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult until you have levelled up a bit. But after that hump (which I cleared this time, awww yeah) it&amp;rsquo;s super-fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Games. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll always be casual gamer but I&amp;rsquo;m really into what Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s doing right now. The Switch is an actual console, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be a gateway into other, more serious games that get ported to it. I&amp;rsquo;m excited!&lt;/p&gt;
