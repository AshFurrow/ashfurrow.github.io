    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening was &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/artsysalon/"&gt;Artsy&amp;rsquo;s third annual Salon&lt;/a&gt;, where everyone at Artsy is invited to show off the art that they create. Not everyone participates, and that&amp;rsquo;s okay, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to celebrate all my colleagues&amp;rsquo; creative outlets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, I display some photographs, but this year I tried something different. The theme of the Salon was growth, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href="/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;learning the guitar since December&lt;/a&gt;, so last night was my big debut!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say, I guess, that I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning guitar &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to sing. The singing was what I was most nervous about actually – I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. I&amp;rsquo;ve performed piano and saxophone in front of much larger crowds, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t sang publicly since elementary school. My colleagues&amp;rsquo; opinions of me mean a lot, and I guess I was afraid of embarrassing myself. Or maybe I still hate my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I performed two songs – covers – one by The Weakerthans and another by their lead, John K Samson. A great Canadian group and artist. The first song was &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5bil0D8WSuxyGSDLA4LxZK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the second was &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1RwhqapZ0XuqDDeSY4Tzbu"&gt;_Heart of the Continent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/6-OFLKdUU0w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I could feel my knees shaking, I was sure everyone could see how nervous I was. But I had rehearsed and felt my body follow muscle memory as my brain slipped into that blissful autopilot. It reminded me of speaking at a conference – something I&amp;rsquo;m pretty comfortable with at this point. But still nerve-wracking. I made a few mistakes, but I kept going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a senior in high school, I performed in the talent show. Well, I started too. About eight bars into &amp;ldquo;American Pie&amp;rdquo; on the piano, I forgot the music. My mind blanked. I panicked and ran off stage. I was afraid I would panic again and forget the music. But even if I did, I felt safe around my colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/582iYsdMHjA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second song went well too, though my legs were still shaking. I rushed the tempo. I always do. In retrospect, I was afraid of the mic; I need to rehearse more with one. That&amp;rsquo;s okay – those are all improvements I can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is I had fun, and that I did it. It was hard and I did it anyway (not always easy with depression). Je pense que quelqu&amp;#39;un se mit a rire au française dans the chanson. Bienvenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time it&amp;rsquo;ll be a little easier, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be a little better. Actually, I recorded &lt;em&gt;Heart of the Continent&lt;/em&gt; a month ago, and re-listening to that recording this morning, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by just how much I&amp;rsquo;ve improved since then.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331082254&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;Thank you to my colleagues and friends for showing up for my debut, and thank you to my wife Ashley for taking some recordings. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have some artefact of my ability – a snapshot of what I could do. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rotating Mastodon Log Files</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been running the &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;mastodon.technology&lt;/a&gt; instance of &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; since April, and I&amp;rsquo;ve written about different things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while administering a server and contributing to the project. One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve only recent learned about is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_rotation"&gt;log rotation&lt;/a&gt;: an automatic task to prevent log files from filling up a disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to a problem I had a month ago. My primary disk filled up, prevent media uploads from working for a few hours (the database was unaffected since it uses a separate disk). The problem was exacerbated by an &lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/3565"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been having with Sidekiq log file sizes, but the root of the issue is that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t rotating Mastodon log files at all. I was just logging in about once a week to do restart the docker containers (thereby clearing the logs). But I forgot one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked some colleagues for advice and they told me about log rotation. So I added the following new, named &lt;code&gt;/etc/logrotate.d/docker-container&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href="https://sandro-keil.de/blog/2015/03/11/logrotate-for-docker-container/"&gt;this helpful post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
  rotate 7
  daily
  compress
  size=1M
  missingok
  delaycompress
  copytruncate
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moves the log contents to a new file and compresses previously moved logs, so I get a disk use increase of about 50MB/day instead of 1GB/day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/rotating-mastodon-log-files/transmit.png" alt="Docker container directory listing" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the logs are still growing, but the instance could now run for months without me restarting docker containers and not run out of disk space. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think Docker has this kind of functionality built in now, but this is working so I&amp;rsquo;m running with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;simple and helpful&lt;br&gt;my disk space woes are over&lt;br&gt;logrotate.d &lt;a href="https://t.co/R2Mfl7j2Kv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R2Mfl7j2Kv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; the javascript lover (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/889102904023539712"&gt;July 23, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, logrotate.d is another &lt;a href="https://www.xkcd.com/208/"&gt;minor skill&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve added to my tool belt that&amp;rsquo;s come from working on and administering Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Source Ideology</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh hey look, my employer &lt;a href="https://artsy.net"&gt;Artsy&lt;/a&gt; is in the news! We got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15983712/artsy-fine-art-galleries-online-auction-sales"&gt;great write-up in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and our recent fundraising was reported on in &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/online-art-marketplace-artsy-raises-50m-plans-to-double-down-on-auctions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tech Crunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Very cool! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of my work at Artsy, and I admire the company and its leadership. I especially like a few things, that I would 
argue have a huge positive impact on our business success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;a href="http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html"&gt;Open Source by Default&lt;/a&gt; policy. We &lt;a href="http://artsy.github.io/open-source/"&gt;generate a lot of open source&lt;/a&gt;: code, tools, frameworks. We create projects for – and contributing back to – the Ruby, Node, iOS, and DevOps open source communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is our adherence to collaboration over disruption. The term &amp;ldquo;disruption&amp;rdquo; is such a cliché of Silicon Valley, and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to focus more on collaborating with existing art market players than &amp;ldquo;disrupting&amp;rdquo; them. As time goes on, folks in the valley are starting to realize that disruption may not be the guaranteed path to business success they thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This really gets to what I like about the company and it’s culture. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iWC7mMp3wr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iWC7mMp3wr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; the nokogiri lover (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/887313271518375936"&gt;July 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think these two paradigms – open source and collaboration – complement each other really nicely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gently&lt;/em&gt; corrected me :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the sentiment of collaboration in lieu of disruption has stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; the nokogiri lover (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/887315061680766976"&gt;July 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artsy&amp;rsquo;s success has always been intrinsically aligned with the company values and open source software. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t build Artsy without open source, especially with such a small team, and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as successful as a business without contributing back to that community. Collaboration is intrinsically connected to that open source software as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something so foundational to Artsy&amp;rsquo;s engineering culture that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to describe. What I&amp;rsquo;ll call our &lt;em&gt;open source ideology&lt;/em&gt; imbues every conversation I have with one of my engineering colleagues. It&amp;rsquo;s contagious. Engineers are drawn to it, they join the company, they drink the Kool-Aid. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine working any other way&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll hear them say. I nod. &amp;ldquo;Neither could I.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is it? Artsy&amp;rsquo;s open source ideology is defined by &amp;ldquo;open source by default&amp;rdquo;, and there are a lot of implications carried in that phrase. To borrow a phrase, open source by default is a &lt;em&gt;mindset&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s the ability for engineers to ask the community for help on a pull request they&amp;rsquo;re having a hard time with. It&amp;rsquo;s taking pride in their work, knowing they can use it and showcase it even after they (eventually) leave the company. It&amp;rsquo;s a sense of ownership, as open source projects created by Artsy engineers are done on their own GitHub accounts – our engineers &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the open source projects they build. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all our software is open, but even our closed source software still has open source components that we contribute back to. And that closed source software is often modularized and open sourced piecemeal anyway. We aim for a sort of&amp;hellip; minimum viable closed source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this open source ideology so important to Artsy&amp;rsquo;s business success? Let&amp;rsquo;s frame the impact in business terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low turnover&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s rare for an engineer to leave Artsy. Turnover, especially in specialized fields like software engineering, is a huge cost for businesses. Replacing engineers is expensive, and we don&amp;rsquo;t often have to do it. That&amp;rsquo;s because we&amp;rsquo;ve got&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaged engineers&lt;/strong&gt;. Our engineering team is really engaged with their work; our internal anonymous surveys back this up. I doubt we could accomplish as much as we do with only 25 engineers if we weren&amp;rsquo;t highly engaged with our jobs. You can read more about the impact of employee engagement on businesses &lt;a href="http://hello.cultureamp.com/hubfs/Impact_of_engagement-whitepaper.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation&lt;/strong&gt;. Smart businesses know that you can never have too much reputation. Artsy is well-known among developers in the open source community. That helps us attract talent, making hiring engineers a lot easier for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiarity with tools&lt;/strong&gt;. Every business relies on open source software, at some level, and our team is familiar with a lot of that tooling. There are teammates available to pair with you on whatever compiler/language/tool issue you&amp;rsquo;re having to find the problem, document a fix, and hopefully submit a pull request back to the project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are a lot of business upsides to working in the open. The risks are pretty minimal too. People tend to overestimate the risks anyway, since the unfamiliar is always scarier than the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ideology is a feedback loop – a sort of flywheel that keeps gaining momentum. The more we contribute to open source, the more we benefit as a business, allowing us to contribute more back, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/artsy"&gt;@artsy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtsyOpenSource"&gt;@ArtsyOpenSource&lt;/a&gt; is committed to spending a lot of our $50MM Series D on writing open source code. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Fb4GxMisrT"&gt;https://t.co/Fb4GxMisrT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Artsy Open Source (@ArtsyOpenSource) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtsyOpenSource/status/887358284553912321"&gt;July 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/artsy/meta/blob/master/meta/what_is_artsy.md"&gt;Our values&lt;/a&gt; are open source. They all contribute to our success. But openness, particularly in software, will always be close to my heart, and I&amp;rsquo;ll see it reflected in our success all the time. I believe that this is how the whole software industry will work, eventually, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to be ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you to experiment with open source by default at your own workplace. Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s open source &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;by demand&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to have closed source! The steps to start open source by default, more rationale behind the idea, and tales of our own progress towards this goal are &lt;a href="https://artsy.github.io/series/open-source-by-default/"&gt;all documented&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out, get in touch if you have questions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; – and &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/"&gt;spoken&lt;/a&gt; – about how we should all be blogging as we learn things. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for many reasons, some selfish and some altruistic. But I&amp;rsquo;ve always said: you really should try and write &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn something. It&amp;rsquo;s when you&amp;rsquo;re best able to describe and bridge the gap between ignorance and understanding. &lt;em&gt;As&lt;/em&gt; you experience the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are other reasons to blog &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn something – contemporaneously with the learning process. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to write about a topic when it&amp;rsquo;s fresh in your mind. Also, even if you &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; to write about something later, it can easily become an item on a todo list that you&amp;rsquo;re likely to put off and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/issues/188#issuecomment-315918906"&gt;not get to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But another reason to blog contemporaneously is that you may just not be able to write about something in the future. A friend recently was laid off and now a blog post they had written contemporaneously – but not published – is out of context and needs to be changed. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re able to fit writing into your schedule – please try to. You never know when life circumstances – job, family, housing – could change. Writing about things &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; you learn them is the best way to capture that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you keep it private, writing is a wonderful way to document knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I encourage you to try it out, even if writing hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a strength for you. I have faith you&amp;rsquo;ll produce something of value.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Left Media and Performative Podcasting</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s the podcast, right? It&amp;rsquo;s by a bunch of hard left folks and they discuss really interesting topics like labour organizing, they provide radical feminist criticisms of popular culture, and they have interesting guests on to discuss their own interesting work. I really enjoy listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: they&amp;rsquo;re a bit problematic. They don&amp;rsquo;t adhere to the usual political correctness typical of the left. The language they use – calling people &amp;ldquo;retarded&amp;rdquo; for example – makes me uncomfortable. They walk a fine line between critique of sexism and sexist critique. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &lt;a href="https://thetrap.fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;when the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CHAPOTRAPHOUSE"&gt;@CHAPOTRAPHOUSE&lt;/a&gt; drops &lt;a href="https://t.co/o1yB9XAUSo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/o1yB9XAUSo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 🌴 illy bocean™ 🌴 (@IllyBocean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IllyBocean/status/851320439896850432"&gt;April 10, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the show gains popularity as a tentpole of radical left culture, it&amp;rsquo;s come under increasing scrutiny (largely from liberals). And while I agree with some of the criticisms lobbed at the show, hating it has become a sort of signifier among liberals that &lt;em&gt;yes, I too think Chapo is problematic&lt;/em&gt;. The liberals that somehow managed to lose to Donald Trump(!) think it in vogue to hate &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; and its fans, and to consider the show to be the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; enemy of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Instead of organizing against Trump or his awful policies, they criticize a left-wing podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our capitalist society is so completely imbued with the ideology that &lt;em&gt;you are what you consume&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hesitant to even admit that I listen to the show (lest I get called out as &lt;em&gt;problematic&lt;/em&gt;). But I am not the podcasts I listen to, and I can enjoy media while being critical of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as the hosts of &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; themselves point out: the show is not politics, it is entertainment. Listening to &lt;em&gt;Chapo Traphouse&lt;/em&gt; is about as effective at fighting fascism as watching Stephen Colbert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m clearly not saying you can&amp;rsquo;t criticize Chapo. I pretty strongly disagree with a lot of the language they use.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald (@Boringstein) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Boringstein/status/885845764655763456"&gt;July 14, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacLean&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; had what is probably the most &lt;a href="http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-rise-of-the-internets-dirtbag-left/"&gt;level-headed analysis of the show&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s emerging popularity. It kind of examines the origins of the show in a roundabout but thoughtful way, interviewing show guest and author Angela Nagle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in dipping your toes in, I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check out this episode that discusses a popular concept among the left: universal basic income.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/332459247&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But just listening to a podcast doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help anything. And I want to help. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading books they mention, researching the topics they discuss, and have started getting involved in real-world organization in the socialist left. This action, too, comes from the show. From the &lt;em&gt;MacLean&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chapo’s Frost sees it, the end goal of Left Twitter and catalyzing podcasts like hers is to help the left regain its footing, to organize—and ultimately unplug. &amp;ldquo;The most important thing social media can do politically has always been to get people off the internet,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;People need to get offline and plug into organizing and campaigns in the real world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The past few months of listening to the show, and the resulting challenges to my existing ideologies, have been tectonic shifts for my politics and even my sense of self (and I was already fairly left-leaning before). I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure where I&amp;rsquo;m going, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit scared. That&amp;rsquo;s okay – change is always scary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;: still a thing. And &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;my instance&lt;/a&gt;, also still a thing! Recently, one of the users on mastodon.technology sat down and &lt;a href="http://www.smays.com/2017/06/ash-furrow/"&gt;interviewed me&lt;/a&gt; about the platform and the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9'&gt;&lt;iframe src='//www.youtube.com/embed/x3FEs8sgXjE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My participation in Mastodon hasn&amp;rsquo;t been steady, but neither was my participation in Twitter at first. I&amp;rsquo;m still finding my feet and my voice there. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what the future holds; this is still an experiment, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where we end up together.&lt;/p&gt;
