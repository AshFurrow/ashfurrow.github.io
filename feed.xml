    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love Twitter. I have a community there of people I talk with, learn from, it&amp;rsquo;s great. But Twitter also has serious problems that stop everyone from being able to participate in that community. That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was keen on App.net, when it was around. It never really had the chance to get off the ground, I feel, since they tried a pay model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, a free-and-open-source distributed microblogging service. Sarah Jeong has great things to say in her article &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mastodon Is Like Twitter Without Nazis, So Why Are We Not Using It?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I was intrigued and signed up to one of the more popular instances that Jeong mentioned in her article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t around too long in &lt;a href="https://awoo.space"&gt;Awoo&lt;/a&gt; before noticing that the existing community was starting to feel uncomfortable with the influx of outsiders. One of the posts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While queer furries are the &amp;lsquo;old guard&amp;rsquo; of mastodon.social&amp;hellip; here we run the joint. You are in our house, and we expect safety and calm to be the order of the day here. If you want something more lively or tech-y, find another instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still wanna stay? If you behave and respect us, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 100% on board with respecting people, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want my presence to make anyone feel like their space is not theirs. So I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to run my own instance for tech folks like me. If you&amp;rsquo;re keen, head over to &lt;a href="https://mastodon.technology"&gt;mastodon.technology&lt;/a&gt; and sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the instance took a few hours of configuration (I&amp;rsquo;m not that great at this) and some email providers aren&amp;rsquo;t letting the confirmation emails through (if you don&amp;rsquo;t get an email, &lt;a href="mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;ll get you confirmed). I put it on a Heroku hobby plan, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how things go. If costs become a burden, I&amp;rsquo;ll throw up a Patreon or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t promise that this instance will be around forever, or ever around next week, but I think that Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s distributed nature makes it a great bet for the future of microblogging (&lt;a href="http://micro.blog"&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; looks promising too). Come hang out, help me build an inclusive community, and have fun. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well well well, look what we have here. After months of toiling in secret, I can finally announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve helped the &lt;a href="https://raywenderlich.com"&gt;Ray Wenderlich team&lt;/a&gt; complete a brand new RxSwift book! &lt;a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/rxswift"&gt;RxSwift: Reactive Programming in Swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/rxswift"&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/rxswift-book-announcement/cover.png" alt="Book cover" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been serving as a technical editor to help make sure the book is correct, awesome, and cohesive. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blast working with Florent Pillet, Junior Bontognali, Marin Todorov, Scott Gardner, and Chris Belanger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been really hard to keep this under wraps, partially because I&amp;rsquo;m so excited about it and partially because people keep asking me for a Swift version of my existing &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/iosfrp"&gt;Functional Reactive Programming on iOS book&lt;/a&gt;. Well it&amp;rsquo;s finally here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is much more than I could have accomplished on my own, from a team that&amp;rsquo;s used to writing top-notch tutorials. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of what we accomplished, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed making it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I wrote about &lt;a href="/blog/building-swift-playground-books/"&gt;Swift Playground Books&lt;/a&gt; and introduced &lt;a href="https://github.com/playgroundbooks/playgroundbook"&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to create them from a regular Xcode playground. There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of work done to the tool by our wonderful contributors, and it&amp;rsquo;s time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick overview of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/"&gt;Swift Playground Books&lt;/a&gt; (for iPad), let&amp;rsquo;s explore what they look like on the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/swift-playground-books/structure.png" alt="Structure of a playground book source" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structure (documented &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/swift_playgrounds_doc_format/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017343-CH47-SW4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) must be strictly adhered to or else the playground book won&amp;rsquo;t work on the iPad. Creating this directory structure and the corresponding manifest plists is tedious, which is why I originally created the tool. Now, compared to the original post, things are much easier to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original format had users writing triple-slash &lt;code&gt;///&lt;/code&gt; comments to delineate playground book pages. Now, chapters are divided into individual Xcode playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/swift-playground-books/new_structure.png" alt="Structure of a rendered playground book" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual pages within a chapter are represented by Playground pages within Xcode. Use the File -&amp;gt; New menu to add pages. Make sure that the page names are lexicographically ordered in the way you want them to appear in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/swift-playground-books/new_page.png" alt="Adding a new page" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also some cool things you can do with special comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//#-hidden-code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"This code gets executed but isn't visible in the book."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//#-end-hidden-code&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*#-editable-code*/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;funcName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*#-end-editable-code*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"The user will be prompted to edit &amp;lt;#funcName#&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"This yields a compiler warning in Xcode ¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;_(ツ)_/¯"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play around and see what you think! For more info, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/playgroundbooks/example"&gt;the example repository&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are bugs in the tool, so if you run into problems please &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/playgroundbook/issues/new"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love open source, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I built this tool (even if I never did end up using it myself). Several students have contacted me for assistance when using it to apply for WWDC scholarships, and it makes my heart swell knowing that people are using my software to advance their own careers. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with the small community that&amp;rsquo;s growing around the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year when Pokémon Go came out, cultural critic Jonathan McIntosh did what cultural critics do: he pointed out an uncomfortable truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surprisingly unpopular opinion of the day: I find it unsettling that the ultimate goal of Pokémon Go is to train your cute pets to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jonathan McIntosh (@radicalbytes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/radicalbytes/status/754147540149219329"&gt;July 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon was a huge part of my childhood – augmented by the nominal determinism of being named &amp;ldquo;Ash&amp;rdquo; – but I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that it&amp;rsquo;s cruel to capture animals and force them to fight. I mean, come on people. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit obvious, if (as McIntosh points out) surprisingly unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the internet being what it is, McIntosh got a bunch of harsh blowback because people are uncomfortable with the idea that something they like could be problematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a detour and talk about my new favourite show: Rick and Morty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricky is a drunk genius who takes his adolescent grandson Morty on adventures through the multiverse. There are actually an infinite amount of Ricks and Mortys, since there are an infinite number of dimensions to exist in. They interact with these alternate versions of themselves and get up to hijinks and in to trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the show, during a hiatus between seasons, released a game that parodied Pokémon: &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rick-and-morty-pocket-mortys/id992640880?mt=8"&gt;Pocket Mortys&lt;/a&gt;. You play as Rick to collect, train, and fight Mortys. Say again: the game is cockfighting, but with your grandson. And it&amp;rsquo;s super fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/pocket-cruelty/pm.png" alt="Pocket Morty's Screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one on the Internet seems to have a problem with this uncomfortable truth, even though the game explicitly highlights the same truth that McIntosh did. During fights, Mortys will scream in pain, they&amp;rsquo;ll whimper &amp;ldquo;this just seems really cruel&amp;rdquo;, and they&amp;rsquo;ll exclaim &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this any more!&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s all part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why does this game get critically reviewed as &amp;ldquo;hilarious&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;quirky&amp;rdquo; while McIntosh gets threatened on twitter – even when both point out the same reality? &lt;a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/rick-and-morty-pocket-mortys-review"&gt;Pocket Mortys even gets compared directly to Pokémon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its best moments, Pocket Mortys has a similar feel and tone to its source material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no one seems to care that it&amp;rsquo;s pointing out the cruelty. The game is an explicit parody of Pokémon, and readily points out how cruel it is to fight Mortys. By extension, the game highlights how cruel it is to fight Pokémon. Yet there has been no pushback against the creators of Pocket Mortys, while McIntosh gets threatened on twitter for essentially saying the same thing. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are uncomfortable when something they like gets criticized as problematic. Well&amp;hellip; tough. Your &lt;a href="https://medium.com/matter/admit-it-your-fave-is-problematic-2dfa692f557b"&gt;favs are problematic&lt;/a&gt;. Your favourite game? Problematic. Your favourite book? Problematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deal. With. It. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m problematic, you&amp;rsquo;re problematic. Everyone is. We all have blind spots – that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us bad people, it just makes us human. What makes us good or bad people is how we respond to uncomfortable realizations. What do you do when it&amp;rsquo;s pointed out that your favourite game or show or author is problematic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I learned from &lt;a href="https://feministfrequency.com"&gt;Feminist Frequency&lt;/a&gt; is to be critical of the media I love. Pocket Mortys is a fun game, and the show is funny as hell, but in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s suuuuuuper problematic. I can enjoy both the game and the show while being critical of them. I swear, it might be uncomfortable at first, but after a while you get used to liking something while recognizing its flaws. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of critical thinking is useful beyond just media, I would argue it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to be a well-rounded member of society.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Depression, as I&amp;rsquo;ve noted extensively, &lt;a href="/blog/depression-sucks/"&gt;sucks&lt;/a&gt;. It sucks really bad, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt;. It sucks &lt;a href="/blog/depression-graphed/"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt;, in unpredictable, sporadic up-and-downs. There are good days, and there are bad days; and there is everything in between: good good days, good bad days, bad good days, and bad bad days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a good bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was talking with my psychiatrist about my medication. It helps me – a lot – but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was getting the most out of it. Additionally, the secondary prescription I&amp;rsquo;m on has some unpleasant long-term side-effects, so if we could find a better primary drug, then maybe we could even go off the secondary altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I began cross-tapering according to my doctor&amp;rsquo;s notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cross-tapering from old to new antidepressants. Worst of both worlds: withdrawal plus new side-effects :&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;mdash; Ash Furrow (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/839504160882049024"&gt;March 8, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have been up and down since then, but I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to really feel the effects of the new medication, and I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that things are going to be on an upswing for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When the SSRI’s are out of your system but the SNRI’s are still kicking in. &lt;a href="https://t.co/y0TTOkkRrE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/y0TTOkkRrE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ash Furrow (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/843893464043606016"&gt;March 20, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the effects of the new meds is that I&amp;rsquo;m more able to recover from problems. And so today, when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go in to work, I was still able to recover and have a good day. It was a bad day – any day I can&amp;rsquo;t go in to the office is generally bad – but it was a good bad day. I got a lot done and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as horrible about myself as I normally do on bad days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another effect of the new medication is that it&amp;rsquo;s helping to augment how effective therapy can be for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress lately. So I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I wrote about &lt;a href="/blog/improving-improvising/"&gt;improvising on guitar&lt;/a&gt;, a follow-up from &lt;a href="/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;when I started learning in December&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy since then, practicing and playing every day. Time for another update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/guitar-update/yousician.jpg" alt="Yousician screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href="http://yousician.com"&gt;Yousician&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a great tool to help develop skills. If you&amp;rsquo;re on Yousician, or you join, please add me as a friend. I find competition for high scores really motivating 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yousician isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete replacement for learning an instrument, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning songs on my own, following YouTube courses, and have my first lesson with a local guitar teacher next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing with some friends, I started a Slack for musicians to collaborate and learn from each other. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, &lt;a href="mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s been nice to have a place to chat and encourage each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording myself as well. Mostly for my own sake and to share with the Slack, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also sent it to my mom (who is very proud of me).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;iframe width="100%" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/312605091&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So yeah, pretty excited. Guitar has become a daily activity for me, something I look forward to doing and something that helps me relax. I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend it 👍&lt;/p&gt;
