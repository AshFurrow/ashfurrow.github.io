I am a world-class software developer living in New York’s East Village. For [five years](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/), I was focused on iOS development, but now I do many things. I'm keenly interested in [TypeScript](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/javascript-is-good-actually/), [ReactNative](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/the-case-for-react-native/), and [GraphQL](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/the-spirit-of-moya/). I'm married, with two cats. After [contributing to open source](https://github.com/ashfurrow) so much, [it brainwashed me](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/open-source-ideology/). I've [written books](/books) and I've [made photos](https://photos.ashfurrow.com) and now I'm [playing guitar](/blog/just-play/).

Community is incredibly important to me; I’ve only been able to accomplish what I have because of the kindness and generosity of others. I owe it to the people who helped me to help others now, which is why I run a [weekly Peer Lab](https://peerlab.community) in New York and volunteer with [Coalition for Queens](https://www.c4q.nyc).

If you want to get in touch, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/@ashfurrow) is probably the best way to reach me. Only if you have to, you can email [ash@ashfurrow.com](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com).

Over my career, I’ve been fortunate to work at some amazing places.

### Artsy

The vision of [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net) is ambitious: a future where everyone is moved by art every day. That vision resonates with me, and I'm proud to work towards it. I help build software for Artsy in JavaScript, Swift, Objective-C, Ruby, Scala – [whatever it takes](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/perspective-of-the-polyglot/). Most of what I work on [is open source](https://github.com/artsy) and I write a lot on [Artsy's Engineering Blog](http://artsy.github.io).

### Teehan+Lax

After learning the importance of design at 500px, I moved to [Teehan+Lax](http://www.teehanlax.com) – Canada’s leading design agency – to learn more. I developed keen collaboration skills while working closely with designers and clients to realize outstanding products.

### 500px

[500px](https://500px.com/) is a site that aims to host the world’s best photography. Like Flickr, but only for your _best_ shots. I developed their first iPad app, and later led the iOS team to ship the new universal app.
