  - heading: Spreading the Word about Swift
    content:
      - By 2015, Swift was public and gaining in popularity. I was an early advocate for the language and based on my experience building the Kiosk for Artsy, I was writing blog posts and giving conference talks on Swift.
      - This was really fun! Swift felt new and exciting, despite the rough edges of the early language betas. It felt nice to dig into a new language and figure things out for the first time.
      - I didn't realize it at the time, but the process of learning a new language and learning its idioms would prepare me for learning yet more languages, on my path to becoming a generalist.

  - heading: Leaving Amsterdam
    content:
      - In February, my wife and I left Amsterdam. 
      - It was bittersweet. We'd lived there a year, and we always knew it would only ever be <em>a</em> year; Artsy hired me with the understanding that I would move to New York after my Dutch visa expired.
      - "Two weeks before I left Amsterdam, something really special happened: Artsy hired <a href='https://twitter.com/alloy'>Eloy Durán</a> of CocoaPods and RubyMotion fame! I'd gotten to know Eloy as a friend through CocoaPods and, just before leaving Amsterdam, had the pleasure of getting to know him in-person as a colleague."

  - heading: Moving to New York
    content:
      - I grew up in the 90's, a 15-minute drive from the border of the state of Maine. After 9/11 and the War on Terror, I stopped going "over across" – It felt like America was too scary. I never imagined I'd one day live there.
      - Yet here I was, moving to New York. We spent 6 hours of limbo between our Airbnb and an apartment we'd found (no small feat for a foreigner with no Social Security Number or credit history). We brought everything we owned, and our cats, to the Artsy office to spend the Saturday.

  - heading: Peer Labs
    content:
      - One thing I missed most from Amsterdam was the sense of developer community that <a href='https://appsterdam.rs'>Appsterdam</a> created. My friend, <a href='https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin'>Samuel</a>, ran a "Peer Lab", a weekly meetup for developers to work independently, but in the same space. I looked forward to it each week.
      - After moving to New York, I quickly <a href='http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/'>set up a Peer Lab at Artsy</a>.
  - heading: Art
    content:
      - Working at Artsy had already afforded me the opportunity to go to art fairs and auctions, and I kept this up. Here you can see me in profile in front of an artwork that Artsy commissioned from Hank Willis Thomas, an artist that I've since followed and gained a huge amount of respect for.

  - heading: Germany Tour
    content:
      - Quickly after moving to New York, my wife and I returned to Europe so I could present at a few conferences. First to Istanbul, then to Berlin. The conferences were a month apart and so we spent a month touring around Germany, couch surfing with friends. I <a href='https://github.com/ashfurrow/EuroTrip-2015'>planned the trip on GitHub</a> and made a lot of friends along the way.

  - heading: Teaching & Learning at UIKonf
    content:
      - In 2014, I attended UIKonf and had a great time. I returned the following year to present a talk titled <em>Teaching & Learning</em>. The thesis of my talk was that sharing knowledge is good, and you should do it for both altruistic and selfish reasons.
      - In the years since my 2015 talk, I've only leaned harder into this "sharing knowledge is good" position. But at the time, this was the apex of my thought processes.

  - heading: Learning to Draw
    content:
      - Over the Summer, I decided to <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/drawing/'>learn to draw</a>. I'd been a photographer for a while but I wanted to expand out and explore different forms of artistic expression. As I learned lessons from making art, I applied those lessons to other parts of my life – including software development.

  - heading: Voting
    content:
      - Voting from abroad in 2015 was really important to me. I abhored the tory government that I'd felt had bullied Canada and tarnished its reputation. I wanted to feel connected to Canada.
      - Of course, Trudeau would go on to <a href='https://trudeaumetre.polimeter.org'>break a lot of promises</a>. Over the next few years, I would feel alienated by the juxtaposition of my disappointment in his government and of the world fawning over Trudeau.
      - I voted to stay connected to my country but it ended up pushing me away.

  - heading: 401 Broadway
    content:
      - Artsy's HQ is located at 401 Broadway, beside Manhattan's Chinatown. I'd been working at the office 5 days a week, with Peer Labs on Saturday, so I developed a bit of emotional connection to the space.
      - My wife and I were renting one bedroom out of a two-bedroom apartment; it never quite felt like home. In the absense of a <em>real</em> home, I think I was drawn to the office as a place of stability.
      - Attaching your personal sense of stability to your employer is never a good idea – businesses are inherently unstable and mooring your sense of self to them is a mistake. And, yet, I seem to make this mistake every time.

  - heading: Product Work
    content:
      - My product work in 2015 wasn't that focused. I worked on Artsy Engineering's "Mobile Team" (as opposed to its "Web Team") and I just build whatever mobile software Artsy needed. I had a tonne of leeway to decide what to work on, but I didn't always have the business context I needed to make that decision.

  - heading: The Auctions Team
    content:
      - I ended 2015 by helping to form Artsy Engineering's <em>Auctions Team</em>. My product work in 2015 hadn't been terribly focused, and I was excited to begin the new year on a new team, focused on building software for Artsy's burgeoning Auctions business.
      - The new team also included a new manager, Alan. Over the next few years, I'd learn a lot from Alan, on both the technical and non-technical sides of software development.
