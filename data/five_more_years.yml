- "2015":
  - heading: Spreading the Word about Swift
    content:
      - By 2015, Swift was public and gaining in popularity. I was an early advocate for the language and based on my experience building the Kiosk for Artsy, I was writing blog posts and giving conference talks on Swift.
      - This was really fun! Swift felt new and exciting, despite the rough edges of the early language betas. It felt nice to dig into a new language and figure things out for the first time.
      - I didn't realize it at the time, but the process of learning a new language and learning its idioms would prepare me for learning yet more languages, on my path to becoming a generalist.

  - heading: Leaving Amsterdam
    content:
      - In February, my wife and I left Amsterdam. 
      - It was bittersweet. We'd lived there a year, and we always knew it would only ever be <em>a</em> year; Artsy hired me with the understanding that I would move to New York after my Dutch visa expired.
      - "Two weeks before I left Amsterdam, something really special happened: Artsy hired <a href='https://twitter.com/alloy'>Eloy Durán</a> of CocoaPods and RubyMotion fame! I'd gotten to know Eloy as a friend through CocoaPods and, just before leaving Amsterdam, had the pleasure of getting to know him in-person as a colleague."

  - heading: Moving to New York
    content:
      - I grew up in the 90's, a 15-minute drive from the border of the state of Maine. After 9/11 and the War on Terror, I stopped going "over across" – It felt like America was too scary. I never imagined I'd one day live there.
      - Yet here I was, moving to New York. We spent 6 hours of limbo between our Airbnb and an apartment we'd found (no small feat for a foreigner with no Social Security Number or credit history). We brought everything we owned, and our cats, to the Artsy office to spend the Saturday.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/cats.jpg
  - heading: Peer Labs
    content:
      - One thing I missed most from Amsterdam was the sense of developer community that <a href='https://appsterdam.rs'>Appsterdam</a> created. My friend, <a href='https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin'>Samuel</a>, ran a "Peer Lab", a weekly meetup for developers to work independently, but in the same space. I looked forward to it each week.
      - After moving to New York, I quickly <a href='http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/'>set up a Peer Lab at Artsy</a>.
  - heading: Art
    content:
      - Working at Artsy had already afforded me the opportunity to go to art fairs and auctions, and I kept this up. Here you can see me in profile in front of an artwork that Artsy commissioned from Hank Willis Thomas, an artist that I've since followed and gained a huge amount of respect for.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/armory.jpg
  - heading: Germany Tour
    content:
      - Quickly after moving to New York, my wife and I returned to Europe so I could present at a few conferences. First to Istanbul, then to Berlin. The conferences were a month apart and so we spent a month touring around Germany, couch surfing with friends. I <a href='https://github.com/ashfurrow/EuroTrip-2015'>planned the trip on GitHub</a> and made a lot of friends along the way.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/hamburg.jpg
  - heading: Teaching & Learning at UIKonf
    content:
      - In 2014, I attended UIKonf and had a great time. I returned the following year to present a talk titled <em>Teaching & Learning</em>. The thesis of my talk was that sharing knowledge is good, and you should do it for both altruistic and selfish reasons.
      - In the years since my 2015 talk, I've only leaned harder into this "sharing knowledge is good" position. But at the time, this was as far as I had pushed into it.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/uikonf.jpg
  - heading: Learning to Draw
    content:
      - Over the Summer, I decided to <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/drawing/'>learn to draw</a>. I'd been a photographer for a while but I wanted to expand out and explore different forms of artistic expression. As I learned lessons from making art, I applied those lessons to other parts of my life – including software development.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/drawing.jpg
  - heading: Voting
    content:
      - Voting from abroad in 2015 was really important to me. I abhored the tory government that I'd felt had bullied Canada and tarnished its reputation. I wanted to feel connected to Canada.
      - Of course, Trudeau would go on to <a href='https://trudeaumetre.polimeter.org'>break a lot of promises</a>. Over the next few years, I would feel alienated by the juxtaposition of my disappointment in his government and of the world fawning over Trudeau. 
      - When I tried to talk about this, online and in real life, my fairly commonsense criticism of Trudeau was met with mild shock. Non-Canadians are, I guess, just not accustomed to thinking about Canada as a country with internal politics. Nor are they aware of the many people to Trudeau's left who are pushing for Canada to live up to the paragon everyone thinks it already is.
      - I voted to stay connected to my country, but it kind of ended up pushing me away. This becomes important later, when Ashley and I decide to become Permanent Residents of the United States.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/voting.jpg
  - heading: 401 Broadway
    content:
      - Artsy's HQ is located at 401 Broadway, beside Manhattan's Chinatown. I'd been working at the office 5 days a week, with Peer Labs on Saturday, so I developed a bit of emotional connection to the space.
      - My wife and I were renting one bedroom out of a two-bedroom apartment; it never quite felt like home. In the absense of a <em>real</em> home, I think I was drawn to the office as a place of stability.
      - Attaching your personal sense of stability to your employer is never a good idea – businesses are inherently unstable and mooring your sense of self to them is a mistake. And, yet, I seem to make this mistake every time.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/officeatnight.jpg
  - heading: Life at Artsy
    content:
      - After UIKonf uploaded the video recording of my <em>Teaching & Learning</em> talk, I shared it within Artsy. That afternoon, Carter (Artsy's CEO) called me on the phone. He said "I watched your talk. Let's do it." And so Artsy created a new blog, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/life-at-artsy"><em>Life at Artsy</em></a>.
      - "My colleague, Remy Ferber, worked on the initial post, <a href='https://www.artsy.net/article/remy-ferber-open-sourcing-company-culture-at-artsy'><em>Open-Sourcing Company Culture at Artsy</em></a>. In it, she says &quot;By promoting openness, we mitigate fear of judgment and embrace our mistakes as positive experiences to learn from and share with others.&quot; This is really key – it speaks to a concept that I didn't yet have the vocabulary to describe: psychological safety."
      - Since starting at Artsy, I understood that the "arts team" (as it was known then) had a strong influence on our engineering culture. The <em>Life at Artsy</em> blog was one of the first times I helped the engineering team export <em>our</em> culture back into the broader company. It was really rewarding.
  - heading: Product Work
    content:
      - My product work in 2015 wasn't that focused. I worked on Artsy Engineering's "Mobile Team" (as opposed to its "Web Team") and I just build whatever mobile software Artsy needed. I had a tonne of leeway to decide what to work on, but I didn't always have the business context I needed to make that decision.
  - heading: Loosely Held Strong Convictions
    content:
      - TODO talk about how this was my most important talk so far. Maybe use it as a way to talk about how I was speaking at fewer and fewer conferenes over time.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2015/pragma.jpg
  - heading: Building Communities
    content:
      - Near the end of the year, I realized how empty I felt about my purpose. Sure, I was building cool software, but that just <em>wasn't enough anymore</em>.
      - I decided that the next skill that I wanted to master was <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-online-communities/'>build online communities</a>. I considered Artsy Engineering one type of online community, while <a href='https://github.com/Moya/Moya'>Moya</a> was another type.
      - After making this decision, I told Artsy's CTO dB, who supported me. I started spending Artsy time researching team dynamics and skills to manage them. I had started down this path enough to realize how little I knew, and i was hungry for more.
      - This was the very beginning of development of my philosophy of software development, which we'll see unfold over the next few years.
  - heading: The Auctions Team
    content:
      - I ended 2015 by helping to form Artsy Engineering's <em>Auctions Team</em>. My product work in 2015 hadn't been terribly focused, and I was excited to begin the new year on a new team, focused on building software for Artsy's burgeoning Auctions business.
      - The new team also included a new manager, Alan. Over the next few years, I'd learn a lot from Alan, on both the technical and non-technical sides of software development.
      - Our first big event was was <a href='https://www.artsy.net/article/sotheby-s-sotheby-s-first-online-only-auction-input-output'>Sotheby's Input/Output</a> auction. Sotheby's is a big player in the auction world, so working with them was a big deal for Artsy. This was kind of stressful! But was a good preparation for the stress that would come next year, building Live Auctions Integration.
- "2016":
  - heading: Film!
    content:
      - I love photography. And since moving to New York, I doubled-down on my love of <em>film</em> photography, particularly. I was shooting mainly black-and-white film so I could develop and scan it myself. It had become an improtant part of my day-to-day life in New York.
      - TODO talk about how art relates to my career, paralleling the note from 2015
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2016/film.jpg
  - heading: Live Auctions Integration 
    content:
      - If 2015 lacked focus, 2016 made up for it (and then some). 
      - "January kicked off six months of <em>intense</em> work on the nascent Auctions team, building Live Auctions Integration (LAI). At the time, Artsy only supported <em>timed auctions</em>: the auction had a pre-set end time and, when that time arrived, whoever was the highest bidder on each lot won that lot."
      - LAI was different. We would be sending an Artsy employee to an actual auction room, to represent all Artsy online bidders. Anyone using Artsy could, in real-time, bid on lots as if they were in the room themselves.
      - That was the idea, anyway. We had a lot of work ahead of us – we wanted to ship an MVP in 4 months.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2016/lai.png
  - heading: A New Look
    content:
      - Artsy offered headshots for our internal team navigator, and I took the opportunity to define a new, standardized avatar. This image <em>became</em> my representation online for over three years.
      - The funny thing is, it was going to be a boring photo. But Orta was there, and encouraged me to give the thumbs up that ultimately became – quite literally – iconic.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2016/thumbsup.jpg
  - heading: SINFO
    content:
      - Early in the year, I took a trip around the world. First, to Lisbon for the <a href='https://sinfo.org'>SINFO</a> conference, and then onto Tokyo for try! Swift.
      - SINFO was a pretty formative experience for me because it was one of the first general-purpose tech conferences, not just targeted at iOS developers.
      - The photo here depicts a billing with me and <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0270665/'>Danielle Feinberg</a>, a lighting artist and director of photography at Pixar. We got to chat over a few meals at the conference, she even attended my talk on functional reactive programming. She had a big impact on me and my career.
      - Getting to speak on the same stage, I felt the difference in scale of what we were presenting. She talked about lighting Pixar films to achieve artistic and emotional affect. Like how our WALL•E’s eyes have a subtle difference in lighting from the other WALL•E robots, and how that difference gets taken away briefly when our main character forgets who he is. 
      - And I was talking about FRP. Important, I guess, but at a very different scale. Danielle Feinberg inspired me because the message she was telling was so much bigger than I was used to thinking about, in a conference talk context. Looking back, I can see a big turn in my own conference talks after I saw how Danielle's talk on combing technology and art.

  - heading: Green Card Process Starts
    content:
      - So far, my wife and I had been living in the United States on a TN-1 visa ("the NAFTA visa"). It had some restrictions that we were initial okay with, but grew tired of as we continued living in the states. And border crossings were a consistently stressful, as it's kind of a weird visa. Especially entering from Europe, airlines get really fussy.
      - Ashley and I decided to ask Artsy to look into our options. Artsy hired a lawyer and we decided to apply for our Green Cards; this would make us Permanent Residents of the United States.
      - The decision wasn't easy. We'd been living away from our families for a few years, and missed home, but felt that being closer (than Amsterdam) would be a reasonable compromise. And living outside Canada already just made the prospect of continuing to do so... justified, somehow. That's how it felt, anyway.
      - This kicked off three years of paperwork, appointments, and headaches. But I have to thank Artsy, especially Gray and Michelle, for always being there to help.
  - heading: LAI Setbacks
    content:
      - Building something new is never easy, and we were trying to build something <em>very</em> new. The backend was written in Scala, using <a href='https://akka.io'>Akka</a> for actor-based programming. The web front-end was written in React (a relatively new technology at Artsy, at the time) and the iOS front-end was written in Swift. Both front-ends communicated to our backend over GraphQL for static data (lot estimates, artist names, etc) and a websocket backend for realtime data (current number of bids, the current highest bid, etc).
      - All this new technology took time to learn. The Auctions team started getting help from other Artsy engineers, especially Orta and <a href='https://github.com/craigspaeth'>Craig Spaeth</a>. I would say that we had about half of Artsy Engineering working on the LAI launch, with the other half cheering us on.
      - Despite our hard work, we had missed our 4-month launch target. The pressure was on. 
  - heading: LAI Pressure
    content:
      - At the time, I didn't think of the LAI work as a "crunch" time. Looking back, I still don't think the term fits the situation. It was more like, there were times that I had to get some space from my work. And that was unusual for Artsy. (I was always able to get that space, and avoided burning out.)
      - Everyone on the team knew that LAI was important, but we also knew that we had to balance working hard with a sustainable pace. Alan and Devang made sure that everyone on the team knew that this was a one-off situation, that crunch time would <em>not</em> become the norm. The would keep their word.
      - A nice side-effect of the intensity LAI development was the equal intensity of the bonds our team formed. I will never forget what it felt like working with Alan, Sarah, Erik, Chris, Katarina, and Barry (with help from Orta and Craig).
  - heading: LAI Launch
    content:
      - We launched LAI in June. I only found out later, but <em>a lot</em> was running on the success of this product. Alan, as well as our PM Devang, had worked hard to insulate us from this pressure. Like, I knew launching LAI quickly was important, but I didn't really understand the consequences of what would happen if we failed. And I'm glad I didn't, to be honest.
      - I was handling the stress <em>okay</em>. Not the best, but not the worst for sure. If I'd known how much was riding on this going well, it would have only made me feel worse.
      - Looking back, as a more leadership-y engineer, I have a profound appreciation for how Alan and Devang handled that stress, with what seemed like unwavering grace. That's a kind of grace I try to imbue now.
      - The launch was a total success. <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/'>Our software worked like a charm</a>, and after the launch, we were all encouraged to take as much time off as we needed.

  - heading: Missing WWDC
    content:
      - This was the first year that I didn't go to WWDC. It felt sad, I suppose. But mostly sad I didn't get to see my friends.
      - Orta went to AltConf, and made these cool pins of his iOS friends to pass out. I still have a complete set! And my mom uses one of my pins as a keychain.

  - heading: Steven Universe
    content:
      - In 2016, my wife recommended that I check out a show called <em>Steven Universe</em>. I did, and was instantly hooked.
      - I <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/steven-universe-and-masculinity/'>started writing about the show</a> pretty quickly. This came at a pretty important time for me, since I was earnestly researching team dynamics, which is an important theme of the show. Orta called <em>Steven Universe</em> "the most 'Ash Furrow' show", which I took as quite the compliment.
      - "If I had to boil <em>Steven Universe</em> down, really far, I would say that the show's message is a coming-of-age story that questions the idealism-versus-pragmatism dichotomy. Steven has his ideals, and the entire world around him pushes him to be pragmatic. The show's answer to this conflict is: \"no, these ideals <em>are</em> pragmatic. It's the world that needs to change.\""

  - heading: Scaling LAI
    content:
      - After building a successful LAI product, we had to scale it. That involved a lot more work that scaling a typical software product; the bottleneck to running a LAI sale was operational, rather than technical.
      - Our focus turned from building out LAI to scaling it, and scaling tools for our colleagues in Auctions Ops. I found this work really fulfilling. Something about making my colleague's jobs easier just felt satisfying in a new, fresh way to me.

  - heading: The 2016 Election
    content:
      - I was in Switzerland during the 2016 election. I remember waking up to the news and thinking "well, maybe I just won't go back."
      - But I had to, of course – my wife and cats were back in New York. Over the next six months, I toyed with the idea of moving back to Canada. It felt like I was obligated to, somehow. But I worked through those feelings. Moving to Canada would solve nothing, and I desperately wanted to continue my work at Artsy.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2016/election.jpg
  - heading: A Cohering Philosophy of Software Development
    content:
      - When you go to my website's homepage, <a href="https://ashfurrow.com">ashfurrow.com</a> <em>used</em> to just show a list of recent blog posts, but <a href="https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/pull/285">as of this pull request</a>, it links to what I considered "important" blog posts. 
      - These initial "important" blog posts were each an attempt to apply what I had learned about team dynamics and turn them into a coherent narrative. I have since taken on the term "compassionate software developer", which I discovered from <a href="https://twitter.com/aprilwensel">April Wensel</a> of <a href="https://compassionatecoding.com">Compassionate Coding</a>. I'm a big fan of her work.
      - Even though I had these initial blog posts, it would still be some time before my thoughts cohered around a central set of ideas. In 2018, I would give a talk (also transcribed it into a blog post) called <a href="/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/">Building Better Software by Building Better Teams</a>. In it, I lay out the evidence-based business value of compassionate software development, with instructions to get started and links to jumping off points.
    img_url: /img/blog/5-more-years/2016/posts.png
  - heading: Peer Lab Community
    content:
      - After starting my own Peer Lab in 2014, I realized that I wanted to expand the idea. I can only run one peer lab, so I started <a href='https://peerlab.community'>peerlab.community</a> that I <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-static-sites-with-middleman/'>built with Middleman</a>. It includes a list of peer labs and instructions to start one. 
      - We now have almost 40 peer labs worldwide, in many different countries. One of the cooler things to come out of this effort is that peer lab organizers are sharing ideas and improving the concept itself. For example, when a San Francisco peer lab organizer visited us in New York, they told us how a small standup helped attendees get to know one another. So now, we do a standup too.
